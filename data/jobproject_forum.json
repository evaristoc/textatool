{"brankaandreja": {"fogcollected": false, "forum": {"foundjob_msg": {"text": "<p>Hi FCC!</p>\n<p>Happy to say, that I got my first job offer/trainee position . The company is a Digital and marketing agency. They do commercials, graphic designs and some basic websites.</p>\n<p>My role will be graphic design and basic webpage development (HTML5, CSS, JS). Basically I was offered a type of a paid apprenticeship, where I work full time, but am supervised by a mentor. The duration is 3 months, after which they will offer me a full time position (if I deliver, that is <img src=\"https://forum.freecodecamp.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\"> ).</p>\n<p>I started FCC 4 months ago. Since then I have done the HTML and basic JS parts. I also completed the beginners JS tutorials on Mozilla Developer Network. I am currently working through a PHP from scratch tutorial on Udemy. I am also finishing up my bachelors in Design and Textile engineering and have been laid off from my sales job 3 months ago. So I have decided (with the financial support of my significant other) to focus on CS rather than seek out another retail job and also focus on finishing school. All in all I had no real experience working in the design or IT industry.</p>\n<p>What got me the opportunity?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I sent out a highly graphic CV (adapted one of those photoshop templates)</li>\n<li>My motivational letter stated I am willing to learn and looking for new challenges</li>\n<li>I would say they liked my weird mix of graphic design skills and basic programming. Most designers (Slovenia : Europe - where I live) only design, but lack the execution part of web design.</li>\n<li>We talked through my previous experience (some wordpress sites, various company designs, SEO optimisation\u2026) and how I tackled the challenges.</li>\n<li>Most of all they liked my self-learning approach. They said, they are looking for someone who will solve different challenges and learn new things as need arises.</li>\n<li>Language skills: I speak 3 foreign languages (English being one of them)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All in all I am very happy. I will be able to learn new skills in a real job environment, earn a small living and continue my web development DIY-ing.  So I feel I will finally kickstart my learning.</p>\n<p>Many thanks to Free Code Camp, for all the technical support but most important the spark of hope! I start this Friday, so wish me luck!</p>", "id": "140668", "sent": null, "link": "https://forum.freecodecamp.org/t/got-my-first-cs-related-position/140668.json"}, "joined": null, "likes_received":

"forum": {"foundjob_msg": {"text": "<p>I\u2019ve been looking forward to writing a post like this for a long time. This Monday, I\u2019ll be starting my new job as a Software Engineer!</p>\n<p>I have an outline for a detailed blog post about how I got to this point, but for now, I want to share some actionable advice to help you get that elusive first developer job.</p>\n<h2>Don\u2019t Rush Yourself</h2>\n<p>I\u2019ve seen a lot of Internet writings about people who\u2019ve gone from no exposure to coding to a hired developer within 6 months. Realize that those people are the unicorns. Be happy for them, but realize it will likely take you at least a year if you have a full time job. I\u2019d spent over two years working through Free Code Camp off and on before I got to a level where companies wanted to talk to me. Don\u2019t think of it as a competition for jobs against other developers where if you move too slow, you\u2019ll get left behind. There are more job openings out there than you could ever hope to apply to.</p>\n<p>Once you get good at building applications, companies will be enthusiastic about getting you in for an interview because there just aren\u2019t many people at that level who aren\u2019t already working for another company. It\u2019s not a race. Once you\u2019re ready, companies will want to hire you. I promise.</p>\n<p>When are you ready?</p>\n<p>When it comes to learning to code, I like to think of it like learning to climb a mountain.</p>\n<p>Before even reaching base camp, you need to learn about what gear you\u2019ll need, how each piece works, and how all the pieces work together. Then, you need to practice using your gear until you\u2019re comfortable. Then, you need to learn to climb. You\u2019ll maybe start on some boulders, then steep hills, then some short peaks, and keep building up skills from there. Over time, you\u2019ll encounter obstacles you\u2019ve never faced before and gain experience and priceless lessons from failures and frustration. The key is to just keep going. Learn from your failures, and move on.</p>\n<p>Do, fail, learn, repeat.</p>\n<p>Eventually, it gets easier and easier, and you can attempt to summit larger and larger mountains.</p>\n<p>Relating that fun metaphor to code, if you\u2019re starting from zero experience, you\u2019ll need to get comfortable with your gear (command line, text editor, Git, HTTP, productivity tools), then learn to climb (HTML, CSS, JavaScript), and finally scale larger and larger rocks, hills, peaks, and mountains. (build more and more complex applications).</p>\n<p>Can you summit a \u201cfourteener\u201d after 6 months? It\u2019s possible, but it\u2019ll be far safer and easier to get very comfortable with all of the aspects of mountain climbing (building applications) first. Once you\u2019ve gained some experience through building many projects, and have built a number of larger, complex applications that reached and extended your limits, companies will see that and desire that same work for their products.</p>\n<h2>Kill Imposter Syndrome</h2>\n<p>Don\u2019t waste time with thoughts like \u201cI can\u2019t get this to work, I must suck at this.\u201d or \u201cI\u2019ll never be a developer at this rate\u201d or \u201cEveryone is so much better than me\u201d.</p>\n<p>Don\u2019t waste precious time doubting yourself, or comparing yourself or your progress with others.</p>\n<p>The only metric that matters is this: \u201cDid I learn something today?\u201d</p>\n<p>If that answer is \u201cYes\u201d, you win. Period.</p>\n<p>It doesn\u2019t matter if your code is still broken, or if you\u2019re still confused about a concept. Learning to program computers is hard. You won\u2019t get certain things right away. It may take a few days, weeks, or even months to understand certain concepts or technologies. That\u2019s normal.</p>\n<p>As long as you\u2019ve learned something today that you didn\u2019t know yesterday, you\u2019re moving in the right direction. Just imagine multiplying that new knowledge you learned today times 365 or 730. Those lessons add up FAST.</p>\n<p>If you\u2019re learning, you\u2019re winning. It\u2019s hard to see in the moment, but if you don\u2019t believe me, just look at the code you\u2019ve produced last month (or even last week). If you find yourself cringing at certain lines, pat yourself on the back. You\u2019ve gotten better at it!</p>\n<p>Over time, those mini-lessons will add up to you becoming a developer that will be capable of bringing real value to companies and customers. If you learn new things and practice everyday, it will truly only be a matter of time before companies will want to hire you, no matter who you are or where you\u2019ve started from.</p>\n<h2>When Are You Ready to Apply for Jobs?</h2>\n<p>In my personal experience, I began getting calls for interviews after I finished my first full-stack application for Free Code Camp, the voting application.</p>\n<p>By that point, I\u2019d completed my Front End Certification, finished all of the API projects, and was ready to work through the remaining dynamic web application projects.</p>\n<p>After finishing the voting app, I decided to build a boilerplate to assist myself and others in bootstrapping the rest of the dynamic web application projects with a modern stack centered around the React ecosystem.</p>\n<p>Get it here: <a href=\"https://github.com/mtrifilo/react-ssr-boilerplate\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://github.com/mtrifilo/react-ssr-boilerplate</a></p>\n<p>The boilerplate offers a starting point with React, Redux, React Router 4, Webpack, Express, MongoDB, and a JSON web token authentication strategy with local auth and OAuth with GitHub. I strongly encourage you to learn each of those technologies individually before diving in, otherwise you\u2019ll hit a brick wall pretty quickly. Frontend Masters offers courses on everything I used for the boilerplate, and the subscription is well worth the $39 a month.</p>\n<p>You don\u2019t need to use React if you don\u2019t want to. Plenty of companies use Vue, Angular, Ember, or even custom built front end frameworks. The important thing is that you get comfortable and proficient in at least one popular framework. They all exist for the same objective: To offer a scalable way to build client side applications. Once you get comfortable with one of them, you can learn the others pretty quickly.</p>\n<p>At this point in 2017, the most popular major frameworks have embraced components as first class citizens, offer helpful CLI tools, have great documentation, large communities, and great debugging tools. You really can\u2019t go wrong with any framework these days. They each have their trade-offs and frustration points, but if you learn them well, they\u2019ll take you very far.</p>\n<p>So, when are you ready to apply for jobs?</p>\n<p>My simple answer: When you are capable of building a simple full stack application, and can provide plenty of code samples on GitHub that show consistent improvement.</p>\n<p>If you\u2019re not comfortable with Git and GitHub, do yourself a huge favor and spend some time on it. It will help you immensely.</p>\n<p>Using GitHub as version control for your Free Code Camp projects, and other personal projects, will allow potential employers to read through your commits and watch you progress in real time. Don\u2019t be shy! If they like what they see in your code, they will be much more confident in wanting to hire you than they would be otherwise. You want your potential employer to have a good idea that you\u2019d be a great fit for the role before you even walk in for the interview. Open sourcing all of your projects will give good companies the evidence and confidence they need to be sure that you\u2019re most likely perfect for the role they need to fill. Just do it!</p>\n<h2>Applying for Jobs</h2>\n<p>One downright lie that I\u2019ve seen all over the web is the idea that job sites are worthless for getting your first developer job. Absolutely false!</p>\n<p>I\u2019ve had a number of interviews from companies I\u2019ve applied to through <a href=\"http://GlassDoor.com\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">GlassDoor.com</a>, and that\u2019s also where I found my current company. In many cases, companies will post ads on many different job sites that all link to the same job application either on the company\u2019s website, or a service like Jobvite.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a grind, don\u2019t get me wrong, but if you can get one interview for every 20 applications, it\u2019s worth it.</p>\n<p>If you\u2019re applying to more than 20 companies without even a phone call, don\u2019t take it personally. There\u2019s likely a reason you\u2019re being passed for other candidates. Revisit your resume, cover letters, and how you\u2019re presenting your portfolio. Google yourself. Look at how you\u2019re presenting yourself through the lense of a hiring manager. Create a \u201cfunnel of success\u201d so that companies visiting any of your portfolio pages will be guided to the best of what you have to offer. If you\u2019ve gotten far enough through Free Code Camp to be ready to apply for jobs, then you already have plenty of apps to showcase. If they aren\u2019t open sourced, put them on GitHub.</p>\n<p>Hiring managers will vet you. They\u2019ll look at your code on GitHub, they\u2019ll look through your tweets, they\u2019ll read your blog. Give them something to get excited about! Don\u2019t bend your Internet life so it looks good for companies, but at the very least, have some recent projects on GitHub to prove you know what you\u2019re doing, and make sure there is nothing offensive on your public social media accounts that may raise doubts about whether you\u2019d follow company policies or code of conduct.</p>\n<p>Don\u2019t get discouraged if you apply to 30 or 40 companies without any interviews. It takes hard work and practice to get your resumes, cover letters, and portfolios polished to the point of getting the attention of employers. Even if you\u2019re the best candidate for the job, employers will usually throw your resume in the trash if it has spelling errors, grammar mistakes, a headshot (Don\u2019t include a picture, ever! It exposes companies to potential legal trouble if they contact you, so they won\u2019t), or lies.</p>\n<h2>Resumes</h2>\n<p>I think it\u2019s safe to say that everyone hates resumes. Candidates, HR people, managers, probably you.</p>\n<p>Unless you\u2019re going to do something very unique and fun with it, just keep your resume as clean and simple as possible. Don\u2019t worry about fancy garnish or flashy fonts. If the fluff makes your resume harder to parse in 10 seconds, that will work against you. A boring, but clear, concise, and readable resume will elicit a mental \u201cThank you for making my job easier\u201d from every manager who reads it. Its purpose is to communicate essential information about a candidate to managers as quickly as possible.</p>\n<p>A hiring manager will only devote a few seconds to reading your resume, so keep the most important things front and center. Make you contact information available, and easy to see quickly. Include your phone number, email address and GitHub profile address at the very least.</p>\n<p>Offer a \u201cSummary\u201d section that will be your elevator speech. A few sentences each of who you are, what you\u2019ve done, and what you can do to make the company more successful. This might need a few revisions over time. Mine certainly did.</p>\n<p>After the summary, add sections for closely related work experience, some projects that showcase the best of what you\u2019ve built (with a short description, and links to a live demos and source code of course), technologies you\u2019re proficient in, and education.</p>\n<p>Order each section based on most impressive to least impressive, but keep the summary at the top so at least that will get read.</p>\n<p>For the technologies section, you\u2019ll want the resume scanners to bring you up if a manager is looking for a reference to words like \u201cJavaScript\u201d or \u201cleftpad\u201d. Don\u2019t be tempted to list everything you\u2019ve ever played with for 5 minutes. Only list a technology if you\u2019ve actually used it in a larger project, and can back up the claim with actual code that proves that you know how to use it effectively. If you want to learn something like Webpack or Sass, spend a few days building a challenging, non-trivial project with the technology you\u2019re learning, and use GitHub for version control. Just like that, you can put it on your resume! If it\u2019s a new language or framework, you\u2019ll need to devote more time to learning and building projects with the new thing. That comes back to the importance of getting very comfortable with one language and framework first. Once you\u2019re good at one, you can pick up others much faster. Use that code-fu to your advantage. The take-away is, only include technologies you can back up with actual code. Too many people include tech that they\u2019ve only used in a small Codepen project, or even have only read about. If you can\u2019t back it up with real code, leave it out. Good managers can pick up on unrealistic boasting very quickly. They\u2019re vetting you, remember?</p>\n<p>No one expects you to know all of the hip technologies. Just be honest and open about what you know and don\u2019t know, and demonstrate that you\u2019re excited to learn new things whenever necessary.</p>\n<p>Education has varying importance depending on the company. Some will only talk to you if you have a CS degree. Others won\u2019t care if you went to college at all as long as you can prove that you can build software. If you\u2019ve earned a degree for anything other than Computer Science, try to include any impressive accomplishments like a high GPA, or and extra curricular accomplishments.</p>\n<p>After all of that, don\u2019t obsess too much about your resume. Your code and your projects will speak much louder. Just make sure you\u2019re completely honest, but highlight what makes you the candidate they should hire. (hint: you have awesome projects you can showcase!).</p>\n<p>Be sure to have a friend, your SO, your Mom, or a recruiter pal read your resume to ensure there are no spelling errors or grammatical errors. Take their advice with gratitude, but with healthy skepticism unless they have experience in recruiting or hiring developers specifically. I\u2019m not an expert either. Trial and error will reveal what works over time.</p>\n<h2>Cover Letters</h2>\n<p>Just write them. If you\u2019re applying to so many companies that it\u2019s becoming a real issue to write cover letters, something else is probably disqualifying you in the eyes of employers. It takes time, it\u2019s annoying, but it will also get the attention of the employers out there that do care about cover letters. There are a lot of companies that take cover letters seriously, and may interview you simply because you cared enough about the role to take the time to write a personal cover letter while the other 30 candidates just gave them cookie-cutter resumes. If this will be your first job related to software development, a cover letter is your chance to explain why you\u2019re going to be amazing for the role, and what projects you\u2019ve done that prove that you\u2019ll be a great addition to the development team.</p>\n<p>Sure, a lot of companies don\u2019t read cover letters anymore, but the ones that do are the ones that take them seriously, and that\u2019s one more way to set yourself apart from the hundreds of other candidates mass-applying to every company they see without even remembering the company\u2019s name.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s easier to get to the top of the resume pile than you might think if you\u2019re willing to put in some extra effort.</p>\n<p>It helps to write a generic cover letter so that you don\u2019t have to write the same basic information over and over again, but most of each cover letter should be unique to each company. It really doesn\u2019t take much time after you write a few. You have a lot to gain from taking the extra time.</p>\n<h2>The Grind is Real</h2>\n<p>The hard truth is if you don\u2019t have any related work experience and your resume lands on the desk of an HR rep, it\u2019s probably going in the trash. It doesn\u2019t matter if you invented the next Webpack. Many HR people aren\u2019t technical (and why should they be?) so they\u2019ll just pick the candidates that are most likely to be hirable based on work experience. If you have no work experience, your profile won\u2019t even be looked at by anyone technical, and your resume will go straight into the trash. I\u2019ve heard this called the HR firewall.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s their loss. The companies you WANT to work for will care more about your actual code and what you can actually do right now than your previous work experience. If you can prove you can produce great results with modern technologies, and can show that you\u2019re very well versed in either JavaScript, Python, PHP, Java, or others, lack of work experience won\u2019t matter as much and you\u2019ll likely at least get called for an interview. Skilled developers are in high demand, and companies don\u2019t necessarily care about where they come from, as long as they can do the job well.</p>\n<p>So how do you find these companies? How do you get your resume from the HR office to the desk of the Software Engineering Manager who will actually look at your code?</p>\n<p>The fastest way is through networking. This isn\u2019t mandatory, but it certainly helps a lot.</p>\n<h2>Networking</h2>\n<p>One of the fastest way to get your resume to the top of the pile is to contact a hiring manager directly, and bypass the company\u2019s Careers page entirely.</p>\n<p>You shouldn\u2019t spam people you\u2019ve never met, but if you go to a meetup where a local company is presenting something cool they\u2019re working on, be in attendance. Oftentimes, they\u2019ll mention that they\u2019re hiring and encourage anyone in attendance to email a manager at the company directly if they\u2019re interested in working for them. That email address could fast-track you to an interview if you\u2019d be a good candidate. You\u2019ll also have the oppurtunity to talk shop with experienced developers you wouldn\u2019t normally meet day to day.</p>\n<p>On the first of every month, Hacker News hosts a \u201cWho\u2019s Hiring\u201d thread, which quickly fills up with dozens of posts by companies hiring developers. Use your browser\u2019s search feature to find the jobs you want. Some companies will provide an email address to a manager who will take a look at your resume and portfolio. When sending a resume to someone via email, treat the body of the email as your cover letter.</p>\n<p>\u201cNetworking\u201d has all sorts of groan-inducing connotations, but it\u2019s very simple. Just talk to people with shared interests. There are a lot of amazing development communities full of people who like to geek out about tech. Don\u2019t go asking people \u201cHey, are you hiring?\u201d, but if you just talk to people about cool things you\u2019re working on that you\u2019re excited about, and cool things they\u2019re working on that they\u2019re excited about, the people who ARE hiring will find you in those situations. People know people, and they talk to each other.</p>\n<p>Worst case scenario, you\u2019ll meet nice people, have some free pizza, hear a talk about something you\u2019re interested in, and learn some new things. The horror.</p>\n<h2>Interviews</h2>\n<p>Interviewing is stressful. There\u2019s no way around it. You just have to go through it and realize that no matter what happens, you\u2019ll always feel better when it\u2019s done. It\u2019s good for you.</p>\n<p>Thankfully, the people who are interviewing you will more than likely be very nice, welcoming, and rooting for your success. If they act cold or condescending towards you, take that as a red flag against the company. Remember, you\u2019re interviewing them, too. Is this a company you\u2019d want to work for?</p>\n<p>The process usually starts with a phone screening, which is a 10-20 minute conversation about the position, what they\u2019re looking for, your experience, and what you\u2019re looking for.</p>\n<p>If the recruiter thinks you could be a contending candidate for the position, and your experience and objective match what the company is looking for, on paper at least, you\u2019ll move on to the next step.</p>\n<p>This is where companies vary widely. You could get a take-home project to work on for a few hours and turn in, or you could be invited to pair-program with a developer, with you in the driver\u2019s seat, and build a small project. You could get both tests. For both take-homes, and pair-programming challenges, the interviewer will likely give you the freedom to pick any library or framework you\u2019d like to build the project. Cool, that means you can just use React because it\u2019s the hip thing, and you\u2019re really good at it, right? You can, but take a step back and think for a moment.</p>\n<p>If you\u2019re task is to build, say, a stop watch with a lap counting feature, is React truly necessary? Think of the pros and cons to bringing in the library. It will make the code more organized, but it\u2019s a small project which won\u2019t be growing or scaling after it\u2019s done. You can use the revealing-module pattern to keep things clean and encapsulated. React is easy to use, but it requires more time and boilerplate to set up vs. vanilla JavaScript. React is fairly lightweight, but it still will add weight to the page that might not be necessary at all if you just use custom design pattern with vanilla JavaScript. React offers great performance for manipulating the DOM, but this app won\u2019t be doing any expensive DOM manipulations. Is React fun and a joy to work with? Yes. The company is using React in production so should you use React in the challenge? Only if it\u2019s required, or the best solution to the problem. In the case of the stop watch app, React is not the best solution to the problem. It\u2019s a small app with simple, predictable DOM manipulations, and it will not need to scale at all once it\u2019s finished. React is not necessary in this case.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s easy to think that you\u2019ll be judged based on finishing the coding challenge, and delivering a working solution, but that is only part of what you\u2019re being judged on.</p>\n<p>I thought I failed my first pair-programming challenge in spectacular fashion. I didn\u2019t come close to finishing the small app I was tasked to build, and I had to look up a lot of basic DOM API methods on the MDN. Even so, I made it to the next round of interviews.</p>\n<p>Why?</p>\n<p>I can\u2019t know for sure, but I can speculate that there were a few reasons. First off, the interviewer was looking at how I approached the problem. Would I reach for the framework I\u2019m most comfortable with instinctively? Or would I use the best solution to the problem at hand, even if I\u2019m less comfortable with it? I ended up scaffolding out the application with vanilla JavaScript, even though I\u2019m terrible with the native DOM API\u2019s, and have to look up methods all the time. Importantly, I demonstrated that I know where and how to look up the methods I need as I need them. It was slow going, and I made a lot of mistakes, but I kept my cool, and worked through the problem one step at a time, talking through it every step of the way. We ran out of time before I got any of the main features done, but the main purpose of the interview wasn\u2019t about finishing the app. It was about getting a sense of how I approach new problems. The interviewer mentioned later that I was working on building the actual app while other candidates who chose React were still setting up the boilerplate. I made the right call.</p>\n<p>One thing to emphasize, vocalize your thinking always while pair-programming in an interview setting. The point of the interview is to see how you approach problems, and they can\u2019t read minds. Talk through what you\u2019re doing. This might seem a bit awkward at first, but just practice by pair-programming with friends or other Free Code Campers, or even just talk through the process on your own to get comfortable with it.</p>\n<p>The next phase after the initial take-home/pair-programming session is usually an on-site interview, though every company is different. At the on-site interview, you\u2019ll generally spend the day at the company getting to know potential teammates and managers, and have a series of interviews throughout the day. Some of them may be one-on-one, others may be with a group. Some will surely be technical, others will be more culture-fit type interviews.<br>\nThe technical interviews may include the dreaded white board questions, but many companies don\u2019t use white boards anymore. If you\u2019re interviewing with companies like Google or Facebook, count on white board questions. At this phase in the technical interviews, you\u2019ll very likely get some questions about data structures and/or algorithms and will be expected to implement a couple. Don\u2019t panic! If you spend a week or two learning or practicing the common data structures and algorithms, you should get to basic level of knowledge where you can implement some simple challenges. For a first programming job, you won\u2019t be given the sort of brain-meltingly difficult CS questions that senior developers get. You\u2019ll get there someday. For you\u2019re first programming job, you\u2019ll be expected to demonstrate that you at least understand how the basic data structures and algorithms work, what bigO notation is, and why time/space complexity is important. You\u2019ll also be asked to implement at least one data structure or algorithm in some way.</p>\n<p>Algorithms and data structures are intimidating at first, but they just take practice. If you made it through pre-calculus in high school, you can handle algorithms and data structures. The important thing is to be able to implement them on your own based on written requirements or very generic pseudocode. Don\u2019t just memorize them! The skillset you want to develop is the ability to implement them yourself. If you can do that, your interviewer can give you any task to build out, and you\u2019ll be able to figure it out on your own. That is a hard, hard skill to develop, and it will hurt your brain and take a lot of time to master. Senior developers make the big dollars for a reason. Don\u2019t get discouraged. Just keep practicing implementing the common algorithms and data structures, and try out some related interview challenge questions. Over time, you\u2019ll get better and better at it. It will be hard, but don\u2019t quit!</p>\n<p>For your first development role, you won\u2019t be expected to know how to implement every data structure and algorithm (your interviewer won\u2019t know all of them, either), so be very open and honest about what you know and don\u2019t know. No matter what questions or problems they present you with, give it your very best shot. Don\u2019t worry about how you\u2019re doing, or what they might be thinking of how you\u2019re doing. Focus 100% of your attention on the problem at hand. If you haven\u2019t learned linked lists yet, but are very familiar with stacks and queues, mention it! They might give you a question about stacks and queues instead, and you\u2019ll be much more prepared to nail the challenge. If you can get proficient with stacks and queues, they know that you can learn linked lists.</p>\n<p>The most important thing to demonstrate when it comes to algorithms and data structures is that you understands what BigO notation is, and its importance. Writing a piece of code that is O(n^2), that could have been O(n), costs real money and CPU cycles in production. Prove to them that you won\u2019t do such a thing.</p>\n<h2>Takeaways</h2>\n<p>Whether or not a company hires you is largely outside of your control. Put your best self forward always, and make learning and gaining experience your primary objective while interviewing. Every interview will be a challenge that will teach you a few things, and you\u2019ll get better and better at it over time. Try not to worry too much about whether a certain company hires you or not. Every interview will get you that much closer to getting an offer from one company or another. Their will always be another company that will want to interview. If you get rejected, learn what you can from it and move on.</p>\n<p>Get comfortable with failure. I\u2019ve gained many priceless lessons from the moments I\u2019ve failed interviews or code challenges. You can\u2019t get those kind of lessons any other way, and pretty much any good developer you\u2019ll talk to will have similar stories. It\u2019s part of the journey. If you can reframe the idea of failure into a oppurtunity to learn something you couldn\u2019t learn any other way, failures take on a whole different significance.</p>\n<p>I\u2019ve heard the adage (horribly butchered): \u201cYou either win, or you learn. The only way to lose is to quit.\u201d</p>\n<p>If you focus on getting better at coding and interviewing every day, you\u2019re winning. That\u2019s it. Period.</p>\n<p>You can have an interview a day, and get rejected every day for a month, but if you\u2019re getting better and better each and every day, there will be a point where you\u2019ll be the best candidate for the right job at the right moment. If you constantly improve, it\u2019s inevitable.</p>", "id": "137709", "sent": null, "link": "https://forum.freecodecamp.org/t/i-got-the-job-heres-what-ive-learned-from-the-job-hunt/137709.json"},

That same resume &amp; portfolio got me 3 face to face interviews without a phone screening, as well as two phone interviews when I went to the companies directly.</p>\n<p>Hang in there guys, it really does work.</p>\n<p>James</p>", "id": "163745", "sent": null, "link": "https://forum.freecodecamp.org/t/i-got-my-first-developer-job/163745.json"}, "joined": null, "likes_received": 89, "views": null, "posts_read_count": 4635, "post_count": 19, "time_read": 81372, "topic_count": 4, "likes_given": 30, "topics_entered": 564}, "chat": {"foundjob_msg": {"text": "", "id": null, "sent": null, "link": null}, "received_msgs": null, "joined": null, "rel_metric": null, "sent_msgs": null}, "fcc_projects": {"tcount": null, "pens": {}}, "github": {"following": 4, "joined": "2016-02-28T08:37:44Z", "followers": 7, "public_repos": 38, "public_gists": 0}, "presence": "cfg"}, "revisualize": {"fogcollected": false, "forum": {"foundjob_msg": {"text": "", "id": null, "sent": null, "link": null}, "joined": null, "likes_received": 2, "views": null, "posts_read_count": 925, "post_count": 7, "time_read": 14599, "topic_count": 0, "likes_given": 1, "topics_entered": 75}, "chat": {"foundjob_msg": {"text": "", "id": null, "sent": null, "link": null}, "received_msgs": null, "joined": null, "rel_metric": null, "sent_msgs": null}, "fcc_projects": {"tcount": 131, "pens": {}}, "github": {"following": 20, "joined": "2012-03-29T20:22:12Z", "followers": 127, "public_repos": 35, "public_gists": 10}, "presence": "cfog"}, "samosale": {"fogcollected": false, "forum": {"foundjob_msg": {"text": "", "id": null, "sent": null, "link": null}, "joined": null, "likes_received": null, "views": null, "posts_read_count": null, "post_count": null, "time_read": null, "topic_count": null, "likes_given": null, "topics_entered": null}, "chat": {"foundjob_msg": {"text": "", "id": null, "sent": null, "link": null}, "received_msgs": null, "joined": null, "rel_metric": null, "sent_msgs": null}, "fcc_projects": {"tcount": 11, "pens": {"http://codepen.io/samosale/pen/rOOPgy/": {"stats": [["220", "Views"], ["0", "Comments"], ["1", "Hearts"]], "created_at": "\n      September 12, 2015\n    ", "title": "FCC News - Angular"}, "http://codepen.io/samosale/full/VvZwvm/": {"stats": [["117", "Views"], ["0", "Comments"], ["Hearts"]], "created_at": "\n      August 26, 2015\n    ", "title": "A Pen by  Sale"}, "http://codepen.io/samosale/full/garjWZ/": {"stats": [["2,784", "Views"], ["0", "Comments"], ["1", "Hearts"]], "created_at": "\n      September 18, 2015\n    ", "title": "Tic Tac Toe"}, "http://codepen.io/samosale/full/KdPMMr/": {"stats": [["1,867", "Views"], ["0", "Comments"], ["2", "Hearts"]], "created_at": "\n      August 27, 2015\n    ", "title": "A Pen by  Sale"}, "http://codepen.io/samosale/full/WQrxQv/": {"stats": [["132", "Views"], ["0", "Comments"], ["Hearts"]], "created_at": "\n      September 14, 2015\n    ", "title": "A Pen by  Sale"}, "http://codepen.io/samosale/full/avowWO": {"stats": [["1,672", "Views"], ["0", "Comments"], ["Hearts"]], "created_at": "\n      August 27, 2015\n    ", "title": "Pomodoro Timer"}, "http://codepen.io/samosale/full/gpVNgo/": {"stats": [["211", "Views"], ["0", "Comments"], ["Hearts"]], "created_at": "\n      August 26, 2015\n    ", "title": "A Pen by  Sale"}, "http://codepen.io/samosale/full/XmgdjK/": {"stats": [["3,030", "Views"], ["0", "Comments"], ["1", "Hearts"]], "created_at": "\n      October 08, 2015\n    ", "title": "Simon Game"}, "http://codepen.io/samosale/full/qObqRR/": {"stats": [["1,747", "Views"], ["0", "Comments"], ["1", "Hearts"]], "created_at": "\n      September 14, 2015\n    ", "title": "A Pen by  Sale"}, "http://codepen.io/samosale/full/KdPBeE/": {"stats": [["1,815", "Views"], ["0", "Comments"], ["2", "Hearts"]], "created_at": "\n      August 28, 2015\n    ", "title": "A Pen by  Sale"}}}, "github": {"following": 45, "joined": "2015-07-02T10:35:54Z", "followers": 16, "public_repos": 48, "public_gists": 23}, "presence": "cog"}, "colshacol": {"fogcollected": false, "forum": {"foundjob_msg": {"text": "", "id": null, "sent": null, "link": null}, "joined": null, "likes_received": 3, "views": null, "posts_read_count": 47, "post_count": 1, "time_read": 1333, "topic_count": 1, "likes_given": 1, "topics_entered": 5}, "chat": {"foundjob_msg": {"text": "", "id": null, "sent": null, "link": null}, "received_msgs": null, "joined": null, "rel_metric": null, "sent_msgs": null}, "fcc_projects": {"tcount": 3, "pens": {}}, "github": {"following": 16, "joined": "2016-05-20T04:53:37Z", "followers": 24, "public_repos": 48, "public_gists": 10}, "presence": "cfog"}, "argvil19": {"fogcollected": false, "forum": {"foundjob_msg": {"text": "<p>I'm from Venezuela and i started to code almost a year ago.

It was actually quite quick for me to find this position. It took me around a month.</p>\n\n<p>I have send around 120 applications. Met 4 recruiters. Got 4 tests. Got 6 phone interviews, 4 physical interviews with 6 compagnies.</p>\n\n<h2>My Background</h2>\n\n<p>I graduated in December from a master in Marketing.<br>I studied as well Graphic Design for a year between 2013 and 2014 where  I learned a lot of HTML and CSS, so before starting on FCC I had already a good knowledge of this.</p>\n\n<h2>My path to a Frond End position</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>HTML and CSS</strong>: As I said, I learned about it when I studied graphic design for a year, I learned a lot about integration from Photoshop to HTML/CSS and responsive design. (Project done: at this time <a href=\"http://vincent-humeau.com/portfolio_le_bacille_damour.php\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">http://vincent-humeau.com/portfolio_le_bacille_damour.php</a> )</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Sass</strong>: This summer I started to learn about Sass, I wanted to challenge myself to learn something new and I realized after that that I wanted to pursue a career in this field. (Project done to master this subject: at this time <a href=\"http://vincent-humeau.com/portfolio_portfolio.php\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">http://vincent-humeau.com/portfolio_portfolio.php</a> )</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Javasript</strong>: Beginning of last December I have start working half of my days to learn Javascript on Freecodecamp and looking at videos on youtube and doing the course on openclasroom.com</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Bootstrap</strong>: In January I learned how to use bootstrap as many jobs were asking about it (Project done to master this subject: at this time <a href=\"http://vincent-humeau.com/portfolio_travel_log.php\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">http://vincent-humeau.com/portfolio_travel_log.php</a> )</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>jQuery</strong>: When I started the the Intermediate Front End Development Projects end of January I realized that I needed jQuery. So did this subject after Javascript but I think it helped me understand it better.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>To get the job</h2>\n\n<p>So basically I have been practicing coding almost full time since December. From mid January I have been sending applications half of the day and the other half I have been working on the FCC projects. When I got my job I only did 3 of the intermediate Front End projects.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Today, I'm really happy with my career path. I'm still doing projects and courses on FCC and look forward to learning a lot of new things <img src=\"https://forum.freecodecamp.com/images/emoji/emoji_one/slight_smile.png?v=3\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\"></p>\n\n<p>My portfolio <a href=\"http://vincent-humeau.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">http://vincent-humeau.com/</a><br>My Github <a href=\"https://github.com/vinceumo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://github.com/vinceumo</a></p>", "id": "102400", "sent": null, "link": "https://forum.freecodecamp.org/t/got-a-job-as-a-front-end-raised-hands/102400.json"}, "joined": null, "likes_received": 28, "views": null, "posts_read_count": 284, "post_count": 3, "time_read": 6435, "topic_count": 2, "likes_given": 0, "topics_entered": 68}, "chat": {"foundjob_msg": {"text": "", "id": null, "sent": null, "link": null}, "received_msgs": null, "joined": null, "rel_metric": null, "sent_msgs": null}, "fcc_projects": {"tcount": 6, "pens": {"http://codepen.io/vinceumo/pen/wgOZQM": {"stats": [["254", "Views"], ["0", "Comments"], ["Hearts"]], "created_at": "\n      February 15, 2017\n    ", "title": "FCC Wikipedia Viewer"}, "http://codepen.io/vinceumo/pen/ZLrLWG": {"stats": [["613", "Views"], ["0", "Comments"], ["Hearts"]], "created_at": "\n      January 31, 2017\n    ", "title": "Random Quote Machine"}, "http://codepen.io/vinceumo/pen/zZRWda": {"stats": [["359", "Views"], ["0", "Comments"], ["2", "Hearts"]], "created_at": "\n      March 20, 2017\n    ", "title": "Twitchtv Coders Live Angularjs "}, "http://codepen.io/vinceumo/pen/JEZLLY": {"stats": [["379", "Views"], ["0", "Comments"], ["2", "Hearts"]], "created_at": "\n      February 05, 2017\n    ", "title": "Weather App"}}}, "github": {"following": 34, "joined": "2016-08-16T19:44:56Z", "followers": 10, "public_repos": 13, "public_gists": 0}, "presence": "fog"}, "jamesgraham": {"fogcollected": false, "forum": {"foundjob_msg": {"text": "<p>After 18 months of learning to code, I just landed my first dev job with a small agency.

During my studies I took on what I assumed was a temporary sales job to make ends meet, but I actually ended up working in a couple of telemarketing companies for a total of 4 years. The latter of those was a digital marketing company, and while working there I started to get the ever-increasing feeling that I should be doing work on the production side instead of sales, which I was doing OK in, but not great. </p>\n\n<p>At this point I had my MA in my back pocket, but I had to be honest to myself and acknowledge that I didn't really have a lot of passion for teaching either, especially compared to the burning desire to start learning how to code.</p>\n\n<p>So what I did was I put some money aside and just straight up quit my job in October 2016, and started learning from the comfort of my flat. First I learned Java through a free online university course, but -- I shit you not -- a drunk software company CEO at a bar told me I should be learning something a bit more modern like JavaScript frameworks instead. So that's what I started doing.</p>\n\n<p>I found FCC, enrolled in some Udemy courses, completed some free tutorials, and in all did a lot of Googling on stuff. Then last Thursday I saw an ad for open positions at a local IT company, and decided to throw them an email. I got a reply 15 minutes later with an invitation to a job interview the next day. I went in, basically was completely honest about what I do and don't know, and today they sent the mail informing me they are gonna give me a shot.</p>\n\n<p>I am extremely enthusiastic, although also a bit terrified, because I'm gonna be working with a whole bunch of technologies I am not familiar with (like React Native, Python/Django and god knows what else). Luckily I fancy myself a fast learner, so it should be fine, and I'm happy to dive into the deep end.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks to FCC for providing an amazing, well-structured, easy-to-use curriculum that doesn't let you off the hook too easy.

The job doesn't pay much (my wife still has way more salary than me lol), but the thought of applying what you've learned for just five months, and actually getting paid for it, is really fulfilling.</p>\n\n<p>A little background about me: I live in the Philippines, where a college degree is the most important aspect of getting a job. If you have no college degree to show, then you will really have a hard time landing a job. I didn't finish college since I needed to stop and start working to meet my family's needs (we are not that rich). I started as a freelance writer since freelance jobs don't necessarily require a college degree to be accepted. However, I've always been fascinated in programming ever since, so when my writing job is not as fulfilling as it was four years ago, I decided to jump ship and focus all of my resources and time to studying how to code.</p>\n\n<p>I started taking web development courses in Coursera. You can apply for a certificate for 70$ per course, or just apply for a scholarship if you don't have the means. While Coursera is really helpful in improving my knowledge, it doesn't give much practical exercises. Thankfully, I found FCC, and it really helped solve real-world problems in the form of its projects.</p>\n\n<p>Fast forward to November, I started applying for jobs on the thought that I won't have any money for Christmas if I don't. Thankfully, a company replied to my application. The process took a week to finish. I was tasked to build a multi-user time tracker app that has different functionalities for admins and regular users, which is definitely out of my area of expertise since I've been focusing on front-end dev, while this app requires backend knowledge. I had to study basic backend and database in three days just to complete this app. Thankfully, they liked my demo and I got a call a week after, saying I got accepted.</p>\n\n<p>This accomplishment would not have been possible if not for this amazing website. The projects that we have to do are really important in improving my skills, as well as my portfolio. The algorithm challenge really helped me in improving my logic and showed me that there are a lot of ways to solve a particular problem.</p>\n\n<p>Lastly, I would like to express my utmost gratitude to the people who helped me in my studies. <a class=\"mention\" href=\"/users/tropicalchancer\">@tropicalchancer</a> has given me the opportunity to join the Rhinos Cohort, and it really changed my web development journey for the better.

Through my interest of free code camp, I found myself becoming interested in many other programming languages like Python, Clojure and C#, giving me a better idea of the utility of all the programming languages. This is the story of how I got my first web development role this week.</p>\n<p>Around the latter half of last year and the begging of this year, I had been working in temporary jobs, usually lasting about 6 weeks each, but I made sure I was getting into non-customer based office work, like data entry for example, just so i was using computers, on the off-chance I would be handed a computer that was off the reigns, and could express myself by writing code. In February this year, that strategy paid off.</p>\n<p>After a few dud jobs (i.e. archaic infrastructures and regressive business ethos), I was eventually employed by a small team of about seven, who were part of a large international parent company. The head of the team gave me a task of acquiring data from websites <em>manually</em>. He then just sat me down in front of a completely fresh, but fairly beaten-up laptop. I knew that this was my chance to benefit from their relaxed and fluid business practices, and so I installed my standard programming environment, with help from the IT team. I got to researching on how I could use programming to solve this problem, I then came up with the most practical approach, being web scraping. When I told him, the head of department was amazed that this could be done with code, and was completely on board, even go so far as congratulating me on the basis of purely showing initiative, and immediately ordered me another monitor (Such a cool guy). However, I hadn\u2019t scraped or done anything remotely like it before, having only completed half of Free Code Camp\u2019s front-end course!</p>\n<p>So, the real issue was, after looking at how i could go about web scraping with JavaScript, I quickly realized that all the books and resources for web scraping were for Python. So, after a little deliberation, I bit the bullet and decided to learn Python in a week. Luckily, python is one of the most elegant languages I have used (Apart from Clojure [Controversial, I know]), so it was actually quite easy to pick it up, and I was scraping my first website within a week.</p>\n<p>While at the company, I made many friends (some of which are now very good friends) who had similar interests in coding and technology, which was great. It was the first time I was part of a community of peers who I could talk to professionally about something I cared about. I also started going to my local JavaScript meet up to build up that network and peer network.</p>\n<p>This went on until the middle of the 4th week, where i unfortunately realized that I would not be able to complete the scraper in time, so I did end up falling back on the manual monkey-work. By the end of the assignment, I had by all accounts failed, and had not provided a full and accurate data set and was dropped by my agency.</p>\n<p>This was a dark time for me, as it felt like i was reverting to the time before I was getting off of my depressed ass to go find work.</p>\n<p>But, with a bit of perseverence, and regularly going to study coding at my library every day after looking for jobs, i finally landed a junior php/lamp stack job.

So I think it would be nice to share some thoughts with you. <img src=\"https://forum.freecodecamp.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\"> Of course, it is all about my experience.</p>\n<p>As for my background, I have a bachelor degree not related to CS, but I did have some experience in a few programming languages, especially Python, which I used for text and data manipulation.</p>\n<p>Some impressions I have got from my studies:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>I think it is really important is to really learn the basics. Truly learn JavaScript before learning React, Angular or even jQuery; learn CSS before learning Bootstrap or Foundation. Your journey will be a lot easier and you will have a btter understanding of what and how things are happening in these frameworks.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You should keep an eye in what the companies are asking to hire someone in the position you want. For me, I was looking for a Front End position and it was clear that overall the most requested skills were good knowledge of ReactJS or Angular. I learned a bit of both (and VueJS, but unfortunately there isn\u2019t a lot of demand for it here in Brazil) and chose to focus in Angular.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Learning Git it is not that difficult but I only got the hang of it after I started using for real in my projects. And you can trust me, it is very useful.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>After I knew I had a solid knowledge of the basics of Webdev and a few good projects to show, I bought a domain and hosted my portfolio to start applying for jobs.</p>\n<p>I was lucky in that I didn\u2019t need to apply for many positions before I got a response from a company. They sent me a test in which I had to make a small app in Angular featuring unit tests that would consume an certain API. Even though I didn\u2019t have a lot of experience I polished the app the best I could, following the good practices I knew of. It was far from perfect, but they liked my test and called for an interview.</p>\n<p>It is a good company and I am very excited with this new step. I am aware that this is just the beginning and I will keep studying and doing my best so I can become a competent developer.</p>\n<p>I am very grateful for FCC. Even though I probably studied more through other sources, it was the most important resource for me in this journey. The structured curriculum and the nice community were so important.

One organisation uses MEAN stack while the other uses RoR + angular + PostgreSQL.</p>\n\n<p>A brief about myself:<br>I reside in India. I've done my masters in Signal processing. I've worked on audio codecs, like dolby atmos,dd+, etc for almost two years for a UK based  company which was not performing well recently, so laid off few people across the globe. I was one of them. Meanwhile I came to know about FCC via Quincy's quora channel. FCC caught my attention and instead of continuing on the same professional path i.e. codecs and all, I started working on FCC curriculum. After almost 6 months of hard work, I've landed myself two Full stack developer job offers(the best part, both companies allow remote work). So I will be working from home for both organisations contributing almost 70-80hrs a week. I want to learn as much as I can, hence the efforts. </p>\n\n<p>Advice to beginners:<br>1)Don't stop asking 'why' and 'how'. I know it may sound cliche', but that's what worked out for me.<br>2)Don't just rely on FCC. Use google,stackoverflow effectively. Take few online courses. Coursera has full stack course for MEAN stack. This course taught me some good concepts.<br>3)And lastly, don't just read the books or watch videos. Code! a lot!</p>\n\n<p>Finally I would like to thank Quincy from the bottom of my heart for developing and maintaining this great community. Without FCC I would not have reached this far. </p>\n\n<p>Cheers <img src=\"//forum.freecodecamp.com/images/emoji/emoji_one/slight_smile.png?v=2\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\"></p>", "id": "50172", "sent": null, "link": "https://forum.freecodecamp.org/t/received-two-full-stack-developer-job-offers/50172.json"}, "joined": null, "likes_received": 66, "views": null, "posts_read_count": 186, "post_count": 4, "time_read": 6547, "topic_count": 2, "likes_given": 7, "topics_entered": 28}, "chat": {"foundjob_msg": {"text": "", "id": null, "sent": null, "link": null}, "received_msgs": null, "joined": null, "rel_metric": null, "sent_msgs": null}, "fcc_projects": {"tcount": 15, "pens": {"http://codepen.io/Ajinkya009/pen/ONQwqj/": {"stats": [["130", "Views"], ["0", "Comments"], ["Hearts"]], "created_at": "\n      April 12, 2016\n    ", "title": "A Pen by  AJINKYA BALASAHEB DESHMUKH"}, "http://codepen.io/Ajinkya009/full/xVmOVv/": {"stats": [["302", "Views"], ["0", "Comments"], ["1", "Hearts"]], "created_at": "\n      May 04, 2016\n    ", "title": "A Pen by  AJINKYA BALASAHEB DESHMUKH"}, "http://codepen.io/Ajinkya009/full/BKMLvb/": {"stats": [["209", "Views"], ["0", "Comments"], ["Hearts"]], "created_at": "\n      May 07, 2016\n    ", "title": "Wikipedia Viewer"}, "http://codepen.io/Ajinkya009/full/qZyGRd/": {"stats": [["339", "Views"], ["0", "Comments"], ["3", "Hearts"]], "created_at": "\n      April 24, 2016\n    ", "title": "Random Quote Generator"}, "http://codepen.io/Ajinkya009/full/rLLYPG/": {"stats": [["178", "Views"], ["0", "Comments"], ["Hearts"]], "created_at": "\n      June 16, 2016\n    ", "title": "POMODORO_CLOCK"}, "https://codepen.io/Ajinkya009/full/PzZMOj": {"stats": [["241", "Views"], ["0", "Comments"], ["Hearts"]], "created_at": "\n      June 11, 2016\n    ", "title": "Javscript Calculator"}, "https://codepen.io/Ajinkya009/full/yJYMbw/": {"stats": [["307", "Views"], ["0", "Comments"], ["Hearts"]], "created_at": "\n      June 07, 2016\n    ", "title": "Twitch Streamers' Info"}, "http://codepen.io/Ajinkya009/full/qNVApz/": {"stats": [["375", "Views"], ["0", "Comments"], ["Hearts"]], "created_at": "\n      July 12, 2016\n    ", "title": "Simon Says Game"}, "http://codepen.io/Ajinkya009/full/rLmbpB/": {"stats": [["175", "Views"], ["0", "Comments"], ["Hearts"]], "created_at": "\n      July 02, 2016\n    ", "title": "tic-tac-toe"}}}, "github": {"following": 2, "joined": "2016-04-10T11:43:47Z", "followers": 2, "public_repos": 62, "public_gists": 0}, "presence": "fog"}, "SRHerzog": {"fogcollected": false, "forum": {"foundjob_msg": {"text": "<p>Last summer I spent a lot of time on Upwork. I had visions of making it as a freelance copywriter. I worked my way up from $3 an hour for transcription to a couple of decent $20+ hourly writing gigs, but then I found a full time job and stopped freelancing for a while.</p>\n\n<p>This summer, I decided I'd rather write code for a living, so I've been learning from FCC and everywhere else. About halfway through the FCC curriculum, I went back to Upwork to update my profile and see if I could find any development jobs. I sent a few proposals but I was a little daunted at the idea of trying to sell myself to freelance clients with no substantial experience in the field, so I decided to just focus on learning enough to qualify for a regular full time job.</p>\n\n<p>A couple weeks later, I got a message on Upwork from a startup in California who needed a React developer. I spoke with the client (VP of engineering) and told him right up front that I had no professional coding experience but I had been learning fast and I was confident that I could deliver good work. He agreed to give me a test project under the guidance of the front end contractor who's on his way out.</p>\n\n<p>Three hours on the phone with the front end guy on Tuesday gave me a real eye-opening introduction to the world of professional Web development. The app only had two views and only called three API endpoints but included thousands of lines of code and a huge pile of dependencies. I felt like I was drowning at first. But then I had time to myself to dig into the project (create a new view) and everything came together for me.</p>\n\n<p>Fast forward to today, and the VP calls back and offers me the job! For at least a month working remotely full time at an entry level hourly wage (lower than most developer jobs, higher than any other steady gig I've done), with the option to continue if we agree that things are working out. He said that they considered some more experienced candidates, but that I stood out for my enthusiasm for learning and my timely and clear communication. The front end guy apparently told him that I showed a lot of potential and they don't want to turn away talent. So now I'm employed for at least a little while and if I fit in well at this company it could be a long-term job. And they came looking for me.</p>\n\n<p>Takeaways:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Creating a profile on Upwork and other freelancing sites can't hurt, and if you already have some work history on such a platform it would be a good idea to keep your profile up to date and see if any clients contact you, even if it's not worth your time to go applying for contracts yourself.</p></li>\n<li><p>Reliable communication and commitment to learning can be your big selling point if you don't have a bunch of (or any) prior experience.</p></li>\n</ul>", "id": "31291", "sent": null, "link":

Out of nowhere as Universe listened my dream, some link about codehour (Hadi Partovi) brought me to another link, I ended up watching youtube video about programming <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STRPsW6IY8k\" rel=\"nofollow\">Why Our Kids Must Learn to Code</a> and it made me enrolled to CodeCademy and later in FreeCodeCamp.</p>\n\n<p>I spent a year trying to figure out JavaScript puzzle in FCC as English is not my mother tongue, but I kept repeating it and finally understood how JavaScript works, but I still have to learn it more deeply.<br>at this time I also fell in love with rails and trying to follow all tutorials about cloning web apps with rails.<br>I am still at front-end intermediate project but all the puzzles I've passed, built a stronger basic front-end skill for me. </p>\n\n<p>As I'm 33 years old now, I have the urge to get a developer job as soon as possible, so I applied to many front-end job vacancies, surprisingly I got many interview invitations despite I don't have IT degree, just personal rails projects in github and FreeCodeCamp projects and competing with younger developers with experience or fresh graduates that agree with entry level salary.</p>\n\n<p>I just believe in law of attraction that if I have passion universe will open doors for me, some interview made me loose confidence, as one interviewer underestimated me by saying that I'm a late gamer, too old to apply for developer job, it was very uncomfortable moment, I lost my confidence, but one article about age issue in applying developer job, made me confidence, because the article said if the interviewer said that to you, it means he is looking for fresh graduates that are willing to receive low starter salary.</p>\n\n<p>I decided not to give up and kept sending resumes, surprisingly one great startup in my city invited me to get an interview. I had nothing to loose so I did my best in the interview and 2 weeks later I got accepted and they offered me experienced (mid-career) developer salary. I keep wondering until now, why they offered me this job, maybe I guess they considered my passion in learning programming, and I owe big thanks to FCC for giving me strong foundation in front-end skill.

My background might be entirely different from a lot of people on the forum, but it shows that with a little determination, any one can get into an engineering role.</p>\n<p>My background:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>No College degree - Currently pursuing a bachelors in Information Sciences and Technology</li>\n<li>Former Military</li>\n<li>I have been working in IT (which definitely helped) in a support analyst/IT Specialist role the past 3 years</li>\n<li>3 projects away from obtaining my front end certification.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>What helped:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>My current job helped me learn all aspect of IT and IT Infrastructure. This was really important because it taught me how distributed systems worked and provided key learning opportunities with networking, enterprise architecture, etc.</li>\n<li>FCC helped me get the programming juices flowing! If I hadn\u2019t gone through any of the pathway, I wouldn\u2019t have passed the programming challenge that my new employer threw at me!</li>\n<li>Learning scripting first definitely made it easier learning the content here.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Current Situation:</p>\n<p>I start work on December 14th with a fortune 500 company located in NYC. I definitely encouraged automation and scripting in my current employer. Anything that came my way, I always tried to analyze the challenge and attempt to solve it with scripting (mainly in Powershell/Bash, we\u2019re a mixed Windows/Linux environment). I\u2019ve been looking for a engineering role for the past year or so. You\u2019ll get discouraged, but don\u2019t let that consume you as it did me for months!  My new role will entail AWS/Azure, working in Puppet, and intergrating RESTful APIs into the infrastructure.</p>\n<p>This post might help people who are already in a technical support role looking to transition, so YMMV. One advice is to ALWAYS keep learning (I know I might be beating a dead horse here).

It\u2019s the culmination of over two years of work (on and off) and I\u2019m extremely excited to begin this new chapter in my life with so many possibilities.</p>\n<h2>My Background</h2>\n<p>I\u2019m 31, have a History degree and work in the advertising industry in London. Mostly sales, but with more of a recent focus on project management of branded content partnerships (videos, photography, articles, social media, TV etc). I\u2019ve worked for some really cool companies and brands on some really interesting projects, but I\u2019ve been unhappy with my careers for a good couple of years, and have always wanted to do something more technical and intellectually rewarding.</p>\n<h2>Learning</h2>\n<p>I started with FCC a couple of years ago, but went through a couple of spurts where I\u2019d consistently progress for a few months before life got in the way and I\u2019d stall and do nothing for months. This summer I really sat down and pledged to dedicate myself to programming and it\u2019s now finally paid off!</p>\n<p>I followed the set course on FCC for the Front End Cert before branching off by myself. A few bits of advice here.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Get off Codepen as quickly as you can. Learn git, learn the command line, learn how to structure a professional looking front end project, learn gulp or grunt, learn how to manage dependencies with npm, learn Sass, get your projects hosted on GitHub pages. None of these skills/technologies are especially complicated to learn, they will make you far more attractive to a potential employer and will very likely be skills you\u2019ll be using on the job. One of the biggest reasons I was able to speak confidently about my abilities in interviews was because I had made the effort to learn and use the modern front end eco-system in a reasonably professional way.</li>\n<li>React isn\u2019t hard to learn (as much as it might seem hard on first glance), it looks great on a CV, and is massively in demand right now. I didn\u2019t find FCC that great for learning React (this may have changed with FCC Beta?) - but this is a good place to start - <a href=\"https://www.udemy.com/react-redux/learn/v4/overview\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://www.udemy.com/react-redux/learn/v4/overview</a>\n</li>\n<li>Be consistent. I set myself blocks of time every day in a calendar to learn and build projects and most weeks was working 25 hours or so outside of my 9-6 job (waking up at 6am to study for a couple of hours, studying in evenings and weekends). Be smart and fit study time around your life in a way which is sustainable for your own circumstances.</li>\n<li>Codewars - this is a great way to learn JavaScript fundamentals and really stretch yourself. Do it as much as you can, while realising that it is your projects which will get your foot in the door for an interview.</li>\n<li>Structure your learning. I went through job listings early in my learning path to list out the technologies that were most demanded by employers and built a plan to learn and showcase most/all of them in projects. Having 90% of the technology boxes ticked against a job description makes it much easier for you to get that interview. Tailor to local market conditions.</li>\n<li>Find other developers or people learning to code to chat to. I\u2019m lucky to know quite a few people in tech (ranging from junior to senior devs, product owners, systems architects and tech managers) who were invaluable in helping me with problems, keeping my morale up and providing advice. Speak to as many people as you can!</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Applying to Jobs</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>People saying job boards are worthless are talking nonsense. Yes, your strike rate will be very low, but who cares when you can apply to scores/hundreds of jobs extremely easily. A good CV and resume template which you can tweak slightly for individual job applications will allow you to apply to jobs very quickly and easily. Why not get your CV out there as much as you can and see what the reception is?</li>\n<li>That being said - leverage your connections and try to speak to hiring managers directly. Cold call them if you have the confidence, and send them speculative emails telling them briefly about your experience and what you could offer their team. This is my sales background coming in handy, but the reality of job hunting is that you are selling yourself, so act like a salesperson. Don\u2019t wait for opportunities to come to you, be proactive. The worst that can happen is a polite email saying \u201cNo thanks\u201d or you get ignored. No big deal.</li>\n<li>London specific - in my limited experiences, this is a candidate\u2019s market. I started searching on January 4 and got my first offers on January 15. I ended up with 4 offers, removed myself from contention prior to final interviews for 3 more companies, and had to turn down numerous other interview offers.</li>\n<li>Emphasie transferrable skills. I have no technical professional work experience or qualification, but interviewers still found a lot of value in my professional background and skills (relationship building, presentation and communication skills, project management, other sales abilities) and this helped me a lot in getting interviews, succeeding in interviews and negotiating. Don\u2019t think your non-technical skills have no value as a programmer!</li>\n<li>Don\u2019t only apply to junior positions. Most of the jobs I interviewed for were advertised as mid-weight positions. Plenty of companies will be open to looking at juniors!</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Interviews</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Almost all companies required a take home technical test. These varied from multiple choice front end technical questions, to building a simple front end responsive homepage, to building more complex applications using data, AJAX calls, building in interactivity etc. If you get a take home project - make sure to comment as much as you can, document the challenges you faced, things you\u2019d improve, additional features you could include and so in with the readme.</li>\n<li>In general interviews, this is the message that you want to get across - \u201cI am passionate about coding, I can problem solve effectively, I have a hunger to pick new skills and develop existing ones, I\u2019m open to new challenges and new approaches, I can communicate clearly about what I\u2019m doing and when I need help.\u201d This is what companies want from juniors. They don\u2019t care too much if you don\u2019t know the exact name for an inbuilt method (I forgot what Math.random() was called in my final interview <img src=\"https://forum.freecodecamp.org/images/emoji/twitter/joy.png?v=5\" title=\":joy:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":joy:\">), but they do care that you can think your way through a problem and that you have an ability and method for finding out how to do something if you don\u2019t know it.</li>\n<li>Interview them! I probably spent more time asking employers questions about their team, what they wanted from a junior, what their tech stack is, how success is measured, what I\u2019d be doing etc than they spent interviewing me. You really want to make the most informed decision possible about the company you\u2019re going to work for, so probe them. Interviewers like this - it shows you have real interest in the role.</li>\n<li>Be patient. Don\u2019t just take the first role which is offered to you. Figure out what you want from a role (technologies, progression opportunities, education opportunities, access to senior devs and mentors, salary, commute time, work culture etc) and make an informed decision which compares these factors. My main decision factors were (in rough order) - access to senior devs/mentors, technology, progression opportunities, salary, and I\u2019ve been very lucky to find a role which ticks all of these boxes more than I thought possible coming into this search!</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Thanks to FCC and <a class=\"mention\" href=\"/u/quincylarson\">@QuincyLarson</a> for building such an amazing platform for people to learn, build a community and spread the message about the possibilities of learning to code without having to spend many tens of thousands of dollars on university courses or expensive bootcamps.</p>", "id": "169874", "sent": null, "link": "https://forum.freecodecamp.org/t/got-a-job-in-london/169874.json"}, "joined": null, "likes_received": 64, "views": null, "posts_read_count": 1366, "post_count": 14, "time_read": 19263, "topic_count": 6, "likes_given": 4, "topics_entered": 175}, "chat": {"foundjob_msg": {"text": "", "id": null, "sent": null, "link": null}, "received_msgs": null, "joined": null, "rel_metric": null, "sent_msgs": null}, "fcc_projects": {"tcount": null, "pens": {}}, "github": {"following": null, "joined": null, "followers": null, "public_repos": null, "public_gists": null}, "presence": "cf"}, "dgparker": {"fogcollected": false, "forum": {"foundjob_msg": {"text": "<p>Hi all, I want to start by saying thank you so much to the development community as a whole and especially freeCodeCamp. The help and support that we are surrounded with is unprecedented and is truly something of legend.</p>\n<p>I\u2019m working at a relatively small tech company 15-30 employees doing front end work on top of their API and back end involving sales on our clients\u2019 sites. Our clients include some very big name companies that are found all over the globe. Needless to say, as a first time developer, IT IS VERY EXCITING!</p>\n<p>Back in December of 2016 I made a commitment and promise to myself that I was going to become a web developer. I had no idea if I was going down the right path or learning the right things or if I was even learning the right things the right way. I googled EVERYTHING! I used freeCodeCamp as my guiding arrow and tried to absorb as much information as possible.</p>\n<p>My Tips:</p>\n<p>Do as many projects as possible, even outside of freeCodeCamp. Between your projects learn something new and then try to implement that in your next project.</p>\n<p>Actually learn JavaScript!!! I cannot stress this enough. During my technical interview, the project leader even commented on the fact that they receive a countless number of applicants who put JS on their resume but don\u2019t actually know simple JS i.e. manipulating arrays, creating objects, editing objects, looping through objects, etc. The algorithm sections for JavaScript on freeCodeCamp helped me beyond belief. I also used Project Euler for added difficulty and more practice.</p>\n<p>Learn additional frameworks. JavaScript alone won\u2019t be enough to make you standout but if you can handle your own within JavaScript picking up additional frameworks will be a breeze. I advise you look at what\u2019s popular in your area, but typically ReactJS, and AngularJS are good places to start.  Another comment the project leader made in the interview was that they don\u2019t mind teaching their developers, they actually enjoy it, but we can\u2019t be teaching the basics. We need to have employees that have a strong foundation that we can build on.</p>\n<p>Use your own text editor. Codepen is extremely nice and helps get your projects off the ground but at the end of the day you\u2019ll want to be comfortable in your own development environment. Also start using Git and GitHub like yesterday. In a professional environment all the work you do will originate and end from here so your going to want to know your way around on day 1.</p>\n<p>Quit trying to measure up. Compare yourself to yourself. All too often we try to meet someone or something\u2019s expectations that are outlandish and wild. This is your path and your choice. You decide where you go and how much time it takes you. If you\u2019ve only been learning for a month don\u2019t look at someone else\u2019s project or code and get discouraged and think you\u2019ll never get there. Instead look at code or a project you did a month ago. Consistently measure your growth to your past self. It will keep you focused and will foster encouragement rather than discouragement.</p>\n<p>Read Quincy\u2019s emails. No seriously read them. The links he posts in those emails include some pretty amazing stuff. They\u2019re always relevant and current.</p>\n<p>Overall it took me 6 months to go from a Nurse to a Web Developer. I worked 3 12-hour days a week, and spent the other 4 learning my butt off. My wife wanted to strangle me for spending so much time on the computer. My son missed me, but I knew the time and effort I put in now would eventually pay off in the future. I switched careers due to love and happiness. I struggled every bit of the way and felt like quitting many times. I set my goals and achieved them no matter how long it took me.</p>\n<p>If you have any questions just comment below. I know how much value can come from gaining any sort of insight into the process and path of switching careers and becoming a web developer so I\u2019ll do my best to give back as much as I can.</p>", "id": "131055", "sent": null, "link": "https://forum.freecodecamp.org/t/i-did-it-my-first-web-development-job/131055.json"}, "joined": null, "likes_received": 37, "views": null, "posts_read_count": 452, "post_count": 12, "time_read": 14759, "topic_count": 4, "likes_given": 0, "topics_entered": 56}, "chat": {"foundjob_msg": {"text": "", "id": null, "sent": null, "link": null}, "received_msgs": null, "joined": null, "rel_metric": null, "sent_msgs": null}, "fcc_projects": {"tcount": 3, "pens": {"http://codepen.io/dgparker/full/ZeaKPx/": {"stats": [["287", "Views"], ["0", "Comments"], ["2", "Hearts"]], "created_at": "\n      March 16, 2017\n    ", "title": "Random Quote Machine OS"}, "http://codepen.io/dgparker/pen/XNWjjJ": {"stats": [["167", "Views"], ["0", "Comments"], ["Hearts"]], "created_at": "\n      November 03, 2016\n    ", "title": "FCC Tribute Page"}}}, "github": {"following": 3, "joined": "2016-10-31T03:47:31Z", "followers": 3, "public_repos": 26, "public_gists": 0}, "presence": "cfog"}, "sok213": {"fogcollected": false, "forum": {"foundjob_msg": {"text": "<p>I am a 21 year old in the United States with no degree.

got my 1st job in coding, and particularly in machine learning! Really excited to share with you guys man! And whole lot of thanks to everyone on FCC! You guys are really awesome!</p>\n\n<p>I think ended up getting a job in the field of machine learning is a quite a different experience from most FCCers, so I hope that sharing these experience with you guys will help you on your decisions making when searching for your dream job in the future, and also open up more options to choose which field to specialise after finishing FCC extensive curriculum. Here is my story and experience to share with you guys.</p>\n\n<p>So I started out on FCC in July last year after dropping out from my university since I couldn't transfer my degree to CS. It was long long hours of coding back then until December when I started FCC backend projects pair-programming with another FCCer. At that time, she and I were also searching for jobs, and since we lived in the same city, and so we can help out each other in finding jobs. She wanted to get a job on UI, especially CSS and RWD, and me particularly on AngularJS or Node.js, no matter as frontend, backend or fullstack developer.</p>\n\n<p>We got interviewed for a few times in our city. But since the pay for a junior developer in my country is extremely low, she then decided to apply for a working holiday visa to UK, and try to get some progressive experiences on UI designing there. And now she is getting a very good pay and learning some really good designing skills there.</p>\n\n<p>About me, after completing some FCC backend projects, but not all, I started to work on some projects of my own based on my ideas, while improving my AngularJS and Node.js skills progressively. After a few months, I came across an article about machine learning, and was really interested in it and got hooked. After the legendary battle between Lee Sedol and AlphaGo, and realising that the pay for a data scientist is extremely high in my country, and with some prior statistics and algebra knowledges, I started to find the resources and tutorials to teach myself the coding skills needed to be a data scientist. I'm very appreciated to have incorporated the self-teaching skills I'd gained from learning experiences in FCC.</p>\n\n<p>Since I've got my coding foundations here in FCC, learning Python to do data science was extremely smooth. While learning data science, I'd joined some hackathons in my city and got to know some really impressive people. Lots of them are from startup accelerator programs. We hanged out sometimes for some coffees and then they brought me to their offices, where lots of startups worked there in a public area. Then I got to know that lots of the startup teams there were hiring. So I bravely talked to lots of the team, and we shared ideas. Very fortunately, one of the team there was looking for someone who can code some machine learning algorithms then deploy it to the backend for production. Knowing that they were hiring, I maintained some meetings weekly with them to tell them what can I do and provide for them. At last, they hired me yesterday!!! It was such a relief!!! Finally!!! This is my dream job!!!</p>\n\n<p>It has been nearly half a year since I left FCC to pursue data science, but this all could happen just because of FCC. Big thanks to all the campers and anywho who'd contributed! Before started out on FCC, I was trampling around in the internet, especially Google to search for tutorials that best fit a beginner. But when I found FCC, I was so excited and instantly knew that I would spent some months on here learning some coding skills.</p>\n\n<p>This is my story, it has been a year since I joined FCC. It was a very long long journey, it's hard but certainly proved to be worth persisting. I hope this story is motivating and encouraging enough and everyone here can get their dream job in the future.</p>\n\n<p>My advices:<br>1. For a non-CS-degree guy like me, getting a job in a typical company is hard. Maybe try interviewing jobs from some smaller startups. If you don't mind a low pay, try to interview for an intern instead of a full-time position.<br>2. Connections are extremely important. Join some hackathons and try to make as much friends as possible in there. You might not know any of their company is hiring! I've a friend of friend of mine who now work in Google just 'cause of a good friend he'd known in a hackathon.<br>3. Everyone feels not employment ready at some point. After all, just don't care about it and show the recruiters and employers all the best projects you've ever done.<br>4. You've learnt a lot from FCC curriculum to become a fullstack dev. But if you're not good at CSS but really good at backend skills like me, you'll have to be more professional on the backend than as fullstack does. If you're good at frontend but not backend, you'll have to be more professional on the frontend than as fullstack does too.<br>5. Possibilities are all out there. You might be feeling not as confident when talking with other devs on some dev topics, just be curious and ask. You'll be improving after all.<br>6. Opportunities are not only to be found but can be created too. Don't be shy to talk about your capable skills. You wouldn't know that the one who you're talking to might need you. You're worth it!</p>\n\n<p>Work hard!!!</p>", "id": "2786", "sent": null, "link": "https://forum.freecodecamp.org/t/got-my-dream-job-in-machine-learning/2786.json"}, "joined": null, "likes_received": 30, "views": null, "posts_read_count": 490, "post_count": 1, "time_read": 6181, "topic_count": 1, "likes_given": 0, "topics_entered": 46}, "chat": {"foundjob_msg": {"text": "", "id": null, "sent": null, "link": null}, "received_msgs": null, "joined": null, "rel_metric": null, "sent_msgs": null}, "fcc_projects": {"tcount": null, "pens": {}}, "github": {"following": 0, "joined": "2016-01-21T19:15:47Z", "followers": 10, "public_repos": 28, "public_gists": 0}, "presence": "cfg"}, "derozan10": {"fogcollected": false, "forum": {"foundjob_msg": {"text": "<p>Hi everyone,</p>\n<p>After a lot of hard work, I\u2019m glad to tell you that I finally got a Front-End Developer job!! <img src=\"https://forum.freecodecamp.org/images/emoji/twitter/tada.png?v=5\" title=\":tada:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":tada:\"><img src=\"https://forum.freecodecamp.org/images/emoji/twitter/champagne.png?v=5\" title=\":champagne:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":champagne:\"></p>\n<p>Next month I will start at an IT-consultancy firm that specializes in web development. They will place me at arguably the biggest retailer in Belgium.</p>\n<p>I am so glad that I can share my story here and tell you a little about my journey. Hopefully, this will encourage people to keep working hard and keep aiming at their goal of becoming a developer.</p>\n<h2>My background</h2>\n<p>Currently I am 28 years old and as far as education goes, I studied economics and hold a bachelor\u2019s degree in SME management. I got former jobs as a purchaser and currently still work in supply chain.</p>\n<p>Soon enough, I figured out I didn\u2019t want to spend my entire life in this field and thought a lot about what I wanted to do professionally. I believe I developed an interest in IT because of my first full-time job purchasing IT-hardware and decided I wanted to go in that direction. I never had any real real programming education before. Funny fact is that until approximately 1.5 years ago, I wasn\u2019t able to properly type with all fingers <img src=\"https://forum.freecodecamp.org/images/emoji/twitter/joy.png?v=5\" title=\":joy:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":joy:\"> .</p>\n<p><strong>Point is that I really had to learn everything for scratch. But I believe when your passionate about something and you know your goal, you can make it work.</strong></p>\n<h2>The road to becoming a Front-end Web Developer</h2>\n<p>I tried studying networking first but found it to theoretical. Web development seemed a better entry point to find a job in IT. I also found out that a lot of resources were available. I am glad to say that I eventually became passionate about web development and really enjoy learning it.</p>\n<p>The learning process itself wasn\u2019t specifically easy. Combining these studies with my hobbies (I play basketball as well) sure made it challenging. My girlfriend and I also had to sacrifice some time together due to long evening (and often late night) coding sessions. Thankfully she understands my goals and is very supportive of it all.</p>\n<p><strong>FreeCodeCamp wasn\u2019t the only resource I used to learn everything I know today, but I really feel like it helped me the most to understand the basics. Furthermore, I really like the hands-on approach. This is why I feel like I owe it to the FreeCodeCamp community to write this post as a big thank you.</strong></p>\n<p>Of course I also used many other resources like books, other platforms, tutorials\u2026 you name it.<br>\nThe most important thing for me was to keep learning and consult different resources until I really understood whatever I was learning at the time. I still take on this approach while learning new stuff.</p>\n<h2>Job search</h2>\n<p>I believe I could have started applying for jobs earlier, but never really had the confidence that I had enough knowledge.</p>\n<p>It helped me when I got over the fact that I would never be able to master everything regarding web development. I also realized that I would learn much more on-the-job trough experience. This is why I actively started applying for jobs 2 months ago.

I stayed at home to raise my family and about 7 years ago start my comeback to my profession. It did not go smooth. 4 years ago I finished 9 months of a full-time course for Web Development and not much changed with the job hunt. I had one part-time no web-based development gig. About 3 years ago I was on the opening day of FCC looking and listening to Quincy poring his heart to us for 8 straight hours. I joined FCC, that is created an account, but since I already finished course a year prior I did not know what to do with FCC. A year ago, out of desperation, I finished the course for Quality Assurance and start applying as a QA Analyst with the same success. Emails from Quincy kept coming and one from a kid from Toronto who went from 0 to $100k in less than a year got me. This May I started FCC for fun. I do not play games so FCC was my play time, my fun time, my relax from QA job hunt. I was on my Tic Tac Toe assignment when I got the email about the new curriculum. Decided to finish last two assignments, claim the old Front End certificate and then move to the new curriculum.</p>\n<p>Started applying for the Front End and Full Stack developers job last Tuesday. Initially, 23 job applications were sent. Out of that 5 companies contacted me. Ove the weekend I finished Java assignment for one of them. On Monday finished phone interview with another, following up with the in-person interview on Tuesday. It was a Senior Front End developer position with the start-up. As I was going for the interview I got the offer for the QA Analyst 3 months contract position.</p>\n<p>Thank you, Quincy. I\u2019ll be back.

I myself am still trying to process it all. After about a year and a few months of learning and 8 months of applying, I finally landed an amazing position as a Front End Developer. Huge shout-out to <a class=\"mention\" href=\"/u/quincylarson\">@QuincyLarson</a> and the dev team for this curriculum. All you really need to know is where to start and which path to take, and I think the freeCodeCamp community provides that.</p>\n<p>So a little bit about my background: I have a degree in anthropology, and took a few intro computer science classes. In terms of my progress here, I completed the Front End portion, most of React (didn\u2019t do the dungeon crawler or Game of Life), API Projects, and 2 Full Stack projects. After that, I just started working on even more projects, and fine tuning the old ones. I\u2019ve also been doing some freelance work as well for a start up.</p>\n<p>As cliche as this sounds, don\u2019t give up hope! There were times where getting a dev job felt like just a dream (just 2 weeks ago as a matter of fact). Once you reach those first few hurdles in the beginning stages, just picture yourself with that dream job. Keep that goal in your mind whenever you hit that speed-bump. Also, get some sleep, please! I would sometimes stay up past 5am trying to solve a problem, my mind completely vacant. But as soon as I sleep and wake up, suddenly the pieces snap together and I get my \u201ca-ha\u201d moment.</p>\n<p>As far as applying for jobs, don\u2019t discount the job boards. However, yes, it took me over 100 applications until I finally started getting some responses, so maybe it might not be for everyone. In addition, try applying out of state/country. I live in New York, and haven\u2019t had a single response from companies here.</p>\n<p>Well that\u2019s it for now, but feel free to ask me any questions!

God, I\u2019ve been waiting to post something in this section since I\u2019ve joined FCC and here I am!<br>\nI joined this community a year ago, but really started working on FCC challenges around October 2016, and when beta of the new curriculum went live I\u2019ve switched to it, so I didn\u2019t even get any of the certificates yet even though I finished all of the beta challenges.</p>\n<p>I also built a simple portfolio website (<a href=\"http://enikolaenko.herokuapp.com\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">enikolaenko.herokuapp.com</a>) and that was pretty much it when I started looking for a job - no degree, no real life projects, nothing. Basically, I just wanted to start job hunting as soon as possible to give myself time to look around, fail a few coding interviews, read \u201cCracking a coding interview\u201d, polish my resume, maybe find a freelance gig\u2026 And after the first coding interview in my life I got the job!</p>\n<p>Now, I have to tell you it was pretty much dumb luck - they needed a junior dev ASAP, they found my resume, I agreed to a pretty modest salary. If I didn\u2019t run into them, I could very well spend several months looking for a job, because a lot of junior positions require 1+ years of experience. I also thought I did really poorly in the interview, cause I was so nervous I couldn\u2019t explain what closure is. I swear, I memorised the definition of closure by heart, and still I was sitting there, staring at the wall blankly like a possessed girl from a horror film for about 15 minutes! And they still offered me the job!</p>\n<p>The question that got me so stunned sounded like this: \"What\u2019s wrong with this code and how to make it work?</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-auto\">      for (var i = 0; i &lt; 5; i++)\n      {\n         setTimeout(function() {console.log(i);}, i * 1000);\n      }\n</code></pre>\n<p>The answer was to wrap it into an IFFE: <code>(setTimeout &lt;...&gt;)(i)</code>, so the function would be called with <code>i = 0, i = 1</code>, etc, instead of <code>i = 5, i = 5</code>, etc, because, well, CLOSURE.</p>\n<p>Other questions  were about prototypal inheritance (almost failed this one), finding the biggest 5-digit number in a string like \u2018123456789\u2019, some basic JS, HTML and CSS and they also asked me about ES6 and if I use promises or callbacks for asynchronous request)</p>\n<p>So, there is no great takeaway from my experience and no useful advice I can give new campers apart from that: <strong>getting a coding a job it really, totally doable and making mistakes or not knowing something is okay.</strong></p>\n<p>I tried to code every day since I\u2019ve started FCC, but some days I could only code for 1 or 2 hours, and some days I had to skip, and I\u2019ve been lazy, and I\u2019ve asked for help, and I never finished reading some books on programming (\u201cEloquent Javascript\u201d got the best of me, but \u201cYou Don\u2019t Know Javascript\u201d series was really helpful, and so were all the books from <a href=\"https://github.com/P1xt/p1xt-guides/blob/master/job-ready.md\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">the guide by @P1xt</a>), and I\u2019ve still got the job (which is not the end of the journey, of course, but it\u2019s an important point).</p>\n<p>The reason I am writing this is, first of all, to brag (obviously), but also - reading topics in this section really helped me to believe I can actually do this and keep studying, so I wanted to share my experience with the community too. FCC community is the best, and I really want to thank <a class=\"mention\" href=\"/u/quincylarson\">@QuincyLarson</a> for making it all possible and all of you guys and gals for being there.</p>\n<p>(I\u2019m starting on Monday and I\u2019m really nervous, so wish me luck!)</p>\n<p>Update: it\u2019s been a week since I started, and so far it\u2019s going perfect! I was really overwhelmed at first, because working on a part of a huge project (my company builds a learning platform for kids) is very different from building a web page or an applet on Codepen on your own; also<br>\nmy company uses a framework of their own design, which is powerful, but really hard to learn, and we write in CoffeeScript instead of plain JS, so I\u2019m still adjusting to that. Also I wasn\u2019t really comfortable with Git, but I am now, after almost losing 8-hours worth of code <img src=\"https://forum.freecodecamp.org/images/emoji/twitter/joy.png?v=5\" title=\":joy:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":joy:\"> Don\u2019t be like me, learn Git.<br>\nBut all in all, I wasn\u2019t sure coding was something I can actually do for a living till I started working, but now I\u2019m very happy!

Here\u2019s a look at my coding journey:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Received my BS in Chemistry in 2014. Loved the problem solving and was really good at the subject but not entirely passionate about it\u2026</li>\n<li>Got accepted to a chemistry Ph.D. program and started in fall 2014.</li>\n<li>Dropped out of the program before Xmas break 2015. I\u2019d enjoyed some aspects like troubleshooting experiments, refining procedures, and teaching, but disliked most organic lab work.</li>\n<li>Got hired for a part-time nanny gig</li>\n<li>I found FCC the week after I dropped out and spent most of my \u2018break\u2019 learning.</li>\n<li>Learned on-and-off while nannying and exploring other income possibilities (i.e. marketing, crafting, writing, etc)</li>\n<li>Started the web dev job search around March 2017 while I was still nannying, but had to leave town to take care of my mom so I put the job hunt on hold.</li>\n<li>Returned home in May and continued my nanny gig (I stopped looking for dev jobs since I was so grateful they\u2019d kept my job open while I was gone). That became a full-time commitment.</li>\n<li>Didn\u2019t do anything coding-related for several months, until I found a part-time marketing job with a tech-related nonprofit. Being in a techy workplace inspired me to start coding again.</li>\n<li>About a month ago, had some minor emergencies that made getting a dev job my highest priority.</li>\n<li>After applying to ~5 jobs per day for a couple weeks, I got an email back from a company hiring for a Web Designer/Developer. They wanted to interview me the next day.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>How I Prepared for the Interview</h2>\n<p>The job ad had been vague with no information at all about the company, except that they wanted someone with experience in Bootstrap, front-end development, Adobe design products, and the Wordpress CMS. When I received their info in the interview email, I immediately jumped onto their websites to do pre-interview research. So note: this wasn\u2019t an agency, but a small business looking for someone to fill their sole developer position.</p>\n<p>My focus in applying or reaching out to companies is to make myself out to be the problem-solver they\u2019re looking for. The sites this company owned had a lot of issues - fixed-size items in responsive containers, div-itis and divs being used to center things in containers, but totally breaking the layout on mobile\u2026 AHH!</p>\n<p>To foster a more conversational interview, I made a gigantic list of topics to bring up so that I could position myself as an expert. I brought my laptop and, during the interview, pulled up Chrome developer tools and Pesticide, sang praises about version control and clean code, and so on. <img src=\"https://forum.freecodecamp.org/images/emoji/twitter/woman_technologist.png?v=5\" title=\":woman_technologist:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":woman_technologist:\"></p>\n<h2>The Offer</h2>\n<p>I know women (and in general, everyone facing impostor syndrome) can be wary about coming off as arrogant or advocating for themselves when it comes to things like salary and career advancement. I\u2019m usually the quiet, non-confrontational type and I\u2019ve never been in a situation of negotiating salary so I was caught a little off-guard during the interview.</p>\n<p>In the interview, my interviewers let it be known that I was the last person of many being interviewed and that they were shooting for an hourly rate that was just kind of\u2026meh. I wasn\u2019t too thrilled about it, so when they asked about my interest level I backed off somewhat and kept insisting my salary requirements were higher than they were looking for.</p>\n<p>Lo and behold, after the weekend, I received an email asking for a second meeting with this company. They started the meeting by saying they talked it through and would meet my salary requirement, and they would be willing to further negotiation in 6 months time.</p>\n<p>I ACCEPTED!</p>\n<h2>More Perspective - Where I\u2019m At</h2>\n<p>I got my job offer ~22 months after starting FCC. There were times when I was coding every day for weeks on end, and then there were times when I didn\u2019t code for months on end.</p>\n<p>When I fell off the bandwagon, I just picked up where I left off. Sure, I had to do some backtracking but there was no need to completely start over.</p>\n<p>I haven\u2019t even finished Free Code Camp\u2019s front-end certification, so don\u2019t feel like you need to have a piece of (virtual) paper in hand to get a job.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://gcamacho079.github.io/my_portfolio/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Here\u2019s my portfolio for reference</a>.</p>\n<h2>My coding advice</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Get a local development environment up and running</strong> as soon as you can.

I got inspired by the success stories quite often and hope I can pass the inspiration onwards!</p>\n\n<p><strong>The history</strong></p>\n\n<p>Like many of you, my educational background is completely different. I have a degree in European Public Administration, however after finishing my study I decided that I wanted something less dull.</p>\n\n<p>I found a job at a communications\\public affairs agency as Product Owner for a web app for 9 months and got a job Project Manager at a small digital agency based on my achievements as Product Owner. However, the stress that I endured as a Project Manager was not my cup of tea and I quit after 4 months.</p>\n\n<p>I took a break and asked myself, what now? I obviously liked computers, new technologies, however I always managed to find an excuse not to start programming. I tried Codecademy before but found it too superficial. Then I read about FCC in a blog...</p>\n\n<p><strong>FCC</strong></p>\n\n<p>I started FCC on december 26th, 2015. I was immediately impressed by the amount of messages and activity in the Gitter chatroom. <em>Wow, so many people, so many messages and nobody is being a d*ck about noob questions...</em> </p>\n\n<p>I raced through the first challenges, motivated by the gamification and made my first portfolio website. Looking at it today brings a smile to my face how far I've come <img src=\"https://forum.freecodecamp.com/images/emoji/emoji_one/sweat_smile.png?v=3\" title=\":sweat_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":sweat_smile:\">. I continued to the algorithms feeling that moment of euphoria every time I found the solution. This feeling still motivates my today.</p>\n\n<p>I continued steadily with the rest of the front end curriculum and also started on the backend.</p>\n\n<p><strong>My freelance projects</strong></p>\n\n<p>February 2016, someone in my family wanted a mobile app and so I decided to take it at a horrible hourly wage, knowing that the experience and the project on my resume would be very valuable. </p>\n\n<p>I made a very badly structured, spaghetti coded Ionic app, which miraculously worked. I've been refactoring this app in the last two weeks and although I've broken pretty much all coding standards and best practices, for the client it all remains the same (lesson 1: functionality &gt; structure &gt; performance).</p>\n\n<p>The experience with Angular proved to be a major asset during my job interviews later on...</p>\n\n<p>I also created two WordPress and one Drupal websites. Even though these paid some bills, I found working with WP (and to a much less extent Drupal) really awkward. A reluctance to learn PHP, frustration with templates and knowing that many people can now create their own websites using editors made me shift focus back to JS web apps (lesson 2: doing what you love is more valuable than short term monetary gains).</p>\n\n<p><strong>My own project</strong></p>\n\n<p>In the meantime I've done a few FCC challenges here and there and got my front end cert (March '16). But I always knew why I wanted to learn to program to create my own awesome, niche web app: Poldocs. It retrieves and searches through political documents from European, National and Local levels. With the learnings from FCC and experience from my other projects I felt super confident that I could pull it off. So in April '16 I started on my own app, full time.</p>\n\n<p>I've never been so motivated in my life as I was when I started this project. I'd spend well over 50 hours a week coding away on this project. <em>Then it bit me in the ass.</em> I originally planned for it to be done at the end of August. I've made a planning, set up my scrum board etc.</p>\n\n<p>Do to the async nature of the import scripts I quickly found myself in callback hell with highly unreadable code. Hurdle 1: Taming the async beast. It took me well over 2 weeks of reading and screwing around before I found the best solution. I played around with promises, function generators and async\\await and having to learn ES6 in the mean time. I'm so glad I -reluctantly- moved over to ES6 and async\\await, now I wouldnt want anything else (lesson 3: <strong>learn ES6\\ESnext as quickly as you can!</strong>). </p>\n\n<p>Hurdle 2 was just around the corner. Having tamed the async beast I had to model a back end. As I have various import sources with all different structures and formats I tried a one size fits all approach. It turned out to be a disaster, I tried to model all kinds of unnecessary metadata from different sources and got frustrated when other sources did not have that piece of information (Lesson 4: keep the scope small, stick to the essentials). </p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, at this point I only did the challenges and 1 project of the back end curriculum and thought I was good enough. <em>I wasn't.</em> I ended up making many rookie mistakes which I had to correct later on. For example, when you know a field\\attribute of an object can contain multiple strings, always use an array. Even if it's empty or only contains one string (Lesson 5: back-end and data modelling is hard. Ask help!).</p>\n\n<p>I even opted for a multimodel database 'cause I though I needed graph functionality, <em>I didn't</em>, which made the whole thing even harder. It is however a really cool database and you should check it out: <a href=\"https://www.arangodb.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Arangodb</a>.</p>\n\n<p>We're talking October '16 now. By this time I'm demotivated by missing my own deadline various times, encountering my own newbie errors and having to fix them, money running out and GF starting to get irritated by lack of results. I hardly code more than 20 hours a week now and starting to get depressed and doubting myself.</p>\n\n<p>I realize I've bitten off more than I can chew. I start to decrease the scope of my project and sticking to the essentials. It helps and slowly I start to regain my confidence, I get most the essentials working within a month, but I won't bring it online till every essential is done. I still need to do full text searching and realize that my chosen DB is not adequate for this solution... F**k, I need to add Elasticsearch...</p>\n\n<p><strong>The job hunt</strong></p>\n\n<p>Money is running dangerously low now, tension with my GF rising. <em>I need a job. ASAP.</em> I wanted to finish my own project as the center piece of my coding portfolio, winged by my paid projects and built on a solid FCC foundation. I doubted that any company would accept a repo of a project that's not even online as legit...</p>\n\n<p>Early november, I see an interesting job ad: JS\\Angular\\React\\Mongo, socially engaged. But it's for a medior level... I decide to call the recruitment agency nonetheless (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6G3kQyqMFpQ\" rel=\"nofollow\">I did see this vid after all</a>). I tell my story how I got into coding, what I've done and what I'm working on. I've read dozens of posts like these with tips so I know my most important asset at this moment is my enthousiasm. <em>It works!</em> The recruiter -let's call him recruiter A- indicates that he'll contact the company to see if they'd consider an entry level applicant with potential <img src=\"https://forum.freecodecamp.com/images/emoji/emoji_one/smile.png?v=3\" title=\":smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":smile:\">.</p>\n\n<p>I feel so happy and proud. The next day I get a call from the recruiter that they're open to my job application, but I shouldn't get my hopes up as they're already taking with several other candidates. <em>That doesn't hold me back!</em> I start on creating my coding portfolio, showing off some of my FCC projects, paid projects and my own -to be finished- projects and send it to the recruiter.</p>\n\n<p>I review what I've learned in the process, HTML5, CSS\\SASS, JS\\React\\Angular, MongoDB, ArangoDB, Docker, Webpack, Ionic, Git, command line, linux, unit testing. Damn, I've come a long way... (Lesson 6: keep track of what you've learned and take a moment to enjoy that occasionally)</p>\n\n<p>3 days later I get a call, they've opted for more experienced applicants. <em>Bummer</em>. But I knew it was a long shot, I'm a junior after all. So I keep searching for jobs, but nearly all require &gt;2 years experience. <em>I thought there was a lack of programmers?!</em></p>\n\n<p>The next week another I see another interesting job ad, this time for a paid traineeship with a large sized IT company, focussed on Oracle databases, but now expanding into web apps. Includes paid training at their company... I might actually have a shot here... I call the recruiter -let's call this one recruiter B- and tell my story again, the guy is super excited by my story and invites me to send my resume and coding portfolio. Next day, I get invited for an interview! <em>Super Hyped <img src=\"https://forum.freecodecamp.com/images/emoji/emoji_one/astonished.png?v=3\" title=\":astonished:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":astonished:\"></em></p>\n\n<p>Next week I arrive at the interview, we start talking. I prepared for a technical interview, but all I get is questions about my personality and how I rate my own programming skills <em>Hell, I don't know, shouldn't you guys determine my level?!</em>. So due to a lack of technical questions I decide to profile myself more as a consultant. I leave the interview with a bad feeling, why the hell did I profile myself as a consultant when I'm applying for a programming job? (Lesson 7: Make sure you ask what the interview process will be like beforehand)  </p>\n\n<p>2 days of uncertainty follow. Then I get a call. I expected to be invited for a second interview, but it's not the recruiter I expected. It's the previous recruiter, recuiter A! As it turns out one of the guys they've offered a job backed out and now they want me to invite me to a job interview. <em>Hell yeah, two companies baby!</em> So I indicate that I'm willing to talk, but I also let the recruiter know that I'm in talks with another company (after all, <a href=\"http://haseebq.com/how-not-to-bomb-your-offer-negotiation/\" rel=\"nofollow\">I've read this amazing article on negotations</a>). Unfortunately the interview will not be scheduled for another week and a half, wonder how this will play out... </p>\n\n<p>The next day recruiter B calls and invites me for a second job interview and indicates that this one will be much more technical. The second interview with company B will be scheduled several days before the interview with company A...</p>\n\n<p>Game day. Second interview with company B. I'm super nervous, barely slept, but I did my homework, saw they use a lot of angular, so I read up on that and also on testing as that is a part of development I've not done much with. I expected a whiteboard interview, but it was just some questions: what does Webpack do, can you explain the difference between an Angular service and Angular controller, what's a REST API, how does lexical scoping in ES6 work... <em>I know all that stuff!</em> Feeling confident I start to fire back some questions which -according to feedback later on- also made an impression (Lesson 8: if you know more than the interviewer is asking, make sure you ask the recruiter about how they handle those subjects). I leave the interview knowing I'll get an offer. <em>Aced it!</em></p>\n\n<p>Two days later I get a call. Company B is offering me a job! <em>However,</em> they said my level is not exactly right for a traineeship, they think I might get bored soon. <em>Allright, so no trainee, I'll take junior!</em> The recruiter continues: \"But junior is also not on your level, we've assessed your code quality with several programmers and although you still have a lot to learn we think a medior position suits your current knowledge\". <em>OMG!</em> They offer a very decent salary + lease car. Hell yeah! I let recruiter B know I'm super excited, but I already promised to go to the interview with Company A, so I'll wait how that goes before committing.</p>\n\n<p>After a few days I have the first interview with Company A. I'm super relaxed for this interview, I already have a job offer which exceeded my expectations so I don't feel any pressure. However, I did my homework and I'm giving them a fair chance so I'm approaching it open minded. We talk about their product and they ask me a few really noobie questions, some of them: if I open a computer case what components do I find? Do you know ES6 at all? Do you know webpack? </p>\n\n<p>I feel a bit insulted. Company B offered me a medior position and these guys from Company A are asking me these kind of questions, WTF!? So I counter: \"Have you checked out my repos?\". The interviewer replies: \"Yes briefly, but only some of them and they weren't really that large.\" So I think to myself, this guy didnt even read my code portfolio and just click a random repo for an FCC Backend Microservice. I keep my cool and respond that I will send him the link of the app I made (which I started to refactor a few days earlier and looks good now) and my Poldocs project.</p>\n\n<p>And he checked it out. The end of the day I get a call from recruiter A that they also want to offer me a job based on the interview and my repos I sent. Furthermore, they also offer me a medior position, a higher base salary but no lease car. The recruiter indicates that they must be really impressed as they want me so much that they decided to skip the second interview.</p>\n\n<p><em>Hell yeah 2 out of 2!</em></p>\n\n<p>Now I have a decision to make. I havent told you about the backgrounds of these companies yet, but it's rather fundamental to my decision. Both companies know I don't do it for the money but rather what I can learn (however when you have two or more companies fight over you, it doesnt hurt to see if you can get more. Did you open <a href=\"http://haseebq.com/how-not-to-bomb-your-offer-negotiation/\" rel=\"nofollow\">this article</a> yet? You should!).</p>\n\n<p>Both companies have given me a detailed description of how they see my growth potential, Company A with a mentor for the first year, Company B in a small team of 4 devs based on equality, no manager, no hierarchy just the team picking up all issues together and discussing best way forward.</p>\n\n<p>I valued both growth paths equal. But Company A is a consulting firm, meaning I'd be working on multiple projects each year being outsourced to different companies around the country (hence the car). Company B on the other hand is in-house, developing their 2 applications from front to back and even managing hosting in house and I'd be expected to contribute to all of that.</p>\n\n<p>Both have their pros and cons. I think consulting is fun: interacting with clients, giving advice, meeting new people constantly. But consulting is also dealing with pressure, deadlines, commuting + traffic jams. You can fill in the opposite for in-house.</p>\n\n<p>In the end I chose for going in house: at this moment in my career I want to work on 2 projects max, know those inside out and I did not feel like I was ready to deal with consulting pressure again. Furthermore there were also some other benefits like working 1 day a week from home, full time is only 38 hours there and a \"13th month\". (Lesson 9: Figure out for yourself what kind of company you want to work in, maybe you feel like you should take whatever comes your way, but so did I and I think I'll be happier this way in the end).</p>\n\n<p>I'll be starting January 2nd!</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Lesson 1: functionality &gt; structure &gt; performance</li>\n<li>Lesson 2: doing what you love is more valuable than short term monetary gains</li>\n<li>Lesson 3: <strong>learn ES6\\ESnext as quickly as you can!</strong>\n</li>\n<li>Lesson 4: keep the scope small, stick to the essentials</li>\n<li>Lesson 5: back-end and data modelling is hard.

{"text": "<p>Hello campers!</p>\n\n<p>I started on FCC a little less than a year ago. I was working part-time (sometimes full time) and I have a 3-year-old daughter. <br>I had been taking some web dev classes on Lynday.com for a few weeks, but javascript seemed... scary. I kept putting off learning it because I did not think I could handle the frustration of programming. I have always been drawn to things that were easy for me, and I didn't enjoy struggling. <br>Someone sent me a link to FCC and I fell in love with the concept. So I powered through. I worked on it whenever I can: when my daughter was napping, when she was gone to bed or early mornings in the weekend... yes, I did wake up around 5-6am on weekends so I could have time work.</p>\n\n<p>I finished the front-end certificate at the end of October. I tried the back-end but really struggled with it. When the Data Visualization certification came up, I started working on that. I am now just one project away from finishing. </p>\n\n<p>While I was learning, I also got involved in our local FreeCodeCamp group and found another local group dedicated to helping people who are learning tech skills online. It was through that other group that I found my first job. A startup company approached the group to find some interns to build the prototype for their app. The app was IOS based, but they also needed a web-based administrator portal. The person responsible for the group recommended me, and just like that, I had the job. (No, I didn't even interview for it <img src=\"/images/emoji/emoji_one/smile.png?v=2\" title=\":smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":smile:\"> )</p>\n\n<p>So in the last weeks, I have been building this portal, reviewing how to properly create forms with React, figuring out how to use Firebase to handle much of the backend (good thing too! I still can't do backend!). I am working on my own with the web stuff. It's not easy. </p>\n\n<p>Now the prototype is coming to an end. We are doing a demo on Wednesday and then not touching that prototype again. They want to start from scratch to build the real app soon. They will be hiring more experienced developers, but I hope they keep me on board as well. If not, at least I got some professional experience. </p>\n\n<p>So the lesson is, there are many different ways to get a job. Networking helps. I am a very shy person, but somehow still managed to network in my own way. If you can, meet other people who are learning, and good things happen. Soon I might be running a web dev. learning circle and I will find other ways to stay involved in this community. <br>I am really excited to see this new career in front of me. I am turning 38 soon (yikes!) and so far only had career interest in fields that don't offer much jobs (Masters degree in History, interest in urban gardening) and jobs that led nowhere (office clerk).</p>", "id": "6022", "sent": null, "link": "https://forum.freecodecamp.org/t/my-first-coding-job-how-i-got-there/6022.json"}, "joined": null, "likes_received": 112, "views": null, "posts_read_count": 4165, "post_count": 70, "time_read": 66804, "topic_count": 22, "likes_given": 7, "topics_entered": 579}, "chat": {"foundjob_msg": {"text": "", "id": null, "sent": null, "link": null}, "received_msgs": null, "joined": null, "rel_metric": null, "sent_msgs": null}, "fcc_projects": {"tcount": 23, "pens": {"http://codepen.io/Marie000/full/yNdrrp": {"stats": [["71", "Views"], ["0", "Comments"], ["Hearts"]], "created_at": "\n      August 22, 2015\n    ", "title": "A Pen by  Marie Pelletier"}, "http://codepen.io/Marie000/full/gPQNop/": {"stats": [["55", "Views"], ["0", "Comments"], ["Hearts"]], "created_at": "\n      February 10, 2016\n    ", "title": "Conway's Game of Life"}, "http://codepen.io/Marie000/full/PPogGa": {"stats": [["122", "Views"], ["0", "Comments"], ["Hearts"]], "created_at": "\n      September 02, 2015\n    ", "title": "A Pen by  Marie Pelletier"}, "http://codepen.io/Marie000/full/KzLNqL/": {"stats": [["21", "Views"], ["0", "Comments"], ["Hearts"]], "created_at": "\n      May 17, 2016\n    ", "title": "D3 Heat Map"}, "http://codepen.io/Marie000/full/jbZqNB/": {"stats": [["163", "Views"], ["0", "Comments"], ["1", "Hearts"]], "created_at": "\n      October 22, 2015\n    ", "title": "A Pen by  Marie Pelletier"}, "http://codepen.io/Marie000/full/PPKGqG/": {"stats": [["107", "Views"], ["1", "Comments"], ["1", "Hearts"]], "created_at": "\n      October 11, 2015\n    ", "title": "A Pen by  Marie Pelletier"}, "http://codepen.io/Marie000/full/WQbNyJ": {"stats": [["98", "Views"], ["0", "Comments"], ["Hearts"]], "created_at": "\n      September 02, 2015\n    ", "title": "Pomodoro Clock"}, "http://codepen.io/Marie000/pen/jWyXEr": {"stats": [["21", "Views"], ["0", "Comments"], ["Hearts"]], "created_at": "\n      January 04, 2016\n    ", "title": "Camper Leaderboard"}, "http://codepen.io/Marie000/pen/JYJodP": {"stats": [["71", "Views"], ["0", "Comments"], ["Hearts"]], "created_at": "\n      October 08, 2015\n    ", "title": "A Pen by  Marie Pelletier"}, "http://codepen.io/Marie000/pen/xwqmag": {"stats": [["85", "Views"], ["0", "Comments"], ["Hearts"]], "created_at": "\n      October 04, 2015\n    ", "title": "A Pen by  Marie Pelletier"}, "http://codepen.io/Marie000/full/wMgpRJ/": {"stats": [["46", "Views"], ["0", "Comments"], ["Hearts"]], "created_at": "\n      January 03, 2016\n    ", "title": "Markdown Previewer"}, "http://codepen.io/Marie000/full/GJbOZd": {"stats": [], "created_at": null, "title": ""}, "http://codepen.io/Marie000/full/dGEWPE/": {"stats": [["117", "Views"], ["0", "Comments"], ["Hearts"]], "created_at": "\n      February 19, 2016\n    ", "title": "D3 Bar Graph"}, "http://codepen.io/Marie000/pen/rOJozj": {"stats": [["53", "Views"], ["0", "Comments"], ["Hearts"]], "created_at": "\n      October 23, 2015\n    ", "title": "A Pen by  Marie Pelletier"}, "http://codepen.io/Marie000/full/wGVqrG/": {"stats": [["159", "Views"], ["0", "Comments"], ["Hearts"]], "created_at": "\n      May 23, 2016\n    ", "title": "A Pen by  Marie Pelletier"}, "http://codepen.io/Marie000/full/oxRgqj/": {"stats": [["26", "Views"], ["0", "Comments"], ["Hearts"]], "created_at": "\n      May 16, 2016\n    ", "title": "D3 Scatter Plot"}, "http://codepen.io/Marie000/full/epJEXo": {"stats": [["38", "Views"], ["0", "Comments"], ["Hearts"]], "created_at": "\n      September 15, 2015\n    ", "title": "A Pen by  Marie Pelletier"}}}, "github": {"following": 0, "joined": "2015-07-10T22:56:31Z", "followers": 6, "public_repos": 28, "public_gists": 3}, "presence": "cfog"}, "Hyllesen": {"fogcollected": false, "forum": {"foundjob_msg": {"text": "<p>Just wanted to say thanks to FCC for getting me a coding job!

I worked through the curriculum in about 9 months working 2 hours a day, then helped convert a food bank website for the Open Source for Good project, a new freeCodeCamp initiative. Working this project involved communicating with another camper in Switzerland, and attending weekly Skype sessions with a freeCodeCamp project manager to plan the upcoming week\u2019s work. It taught me a lot about using version control in a team setting, especially when we opened up the project to general contributions from the freeCodeCamp community, and my partner and I had to evaluate pull requests. You can learn a lot from the free material on the internet, but these sorts of skills - working together on a project with other people - are really difficult to pick up outside of the workplace.</p>\n<p>I can\u2019t stress enough the importance of networking and getting yourself out there. It\u2019s not necessary to have great people skills to network successfully - my people skills certainly are not my strong point! The important thing is to make people aware that you\u2019re available and what you\u2019re capable of. I live in a somewhat remote location that doesn\u2019t have a lot networking opportunities, but it does have a weekly \u201dproject night\u201c at a coffee shop attended by professional web developers. I went to the meeting as often as I could, showed people what I was working on for freeCodeCamp, and asked for help when I was stuck on something. Eventually someone recognized my value (or took pity on me) and offered me a job.</p>\n<p>Incidentally, I must have applied for dozens of jobs posted on the Internet, and I don\u2019t think I got a human response to any of them. Don\u2019t be discouraged if you\u2019re not finding any luck applying for jobs. Companies that post positions publicly get an enormous quantity of applicants, and accordingly have very high standards for those they hire. The job I was just hired to do involves writing Java and Objective-C code for a mobile app. I don\u2019t have any experience writing code for a mobile platform, but my boss was confident, based on what he knew about me, that I could learn these skills effectively. It\u2019s unlikely I would have even gotten an interview for this job without knowing my employer. The secret to finding a job is networking. In most cities of any size there are a lot of opportunities to meet people - hack-a-thons, project nights, lectures, freeCodeCamp coffee-and-code events, and more. I encourage everyone working through freeCodeCamp to go to as many of these events as they can.</p>\n<p>Best of luck,<br>\nPeter Deal</p>", "id": "111038", "sent": null, "link":

By that time I was also working by my profession. I started with Codacademy and then joined local Code Camp in Armenia for two months. However, I could not devote much time to my learning as I was working as well. Then we moved to Canada and it has just passed four months and one bright day I am getting TWO web development offers (after applying for nearly 700 jobs).

I think it's important for me to share my story because it may motivate some of you. </p>\n\n<p>I'm brazilian, 28 years old, and I had no background in coding. 'Till now, I've been working as a bank teller , for 4 years, and I hated it, so I left my job to try something else before I get too much old lol.</p>\n\n<p> So I decided to become a developer exactly in july, 18, after watching <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKIu9yen5nc\" rel=\"nofollow\">this video</a>. I made a commitment to myself that I would study at least 8 hours/day to see how long it would take for me to get my first job. </p>\n\n<p>So I took about 4 months of study untill my first job. But I was checking the spreadsheet I made to control my studytime, and I realize that I studied only about 5 hours a day (wknds not included). It's a little hard to follow the schedule when your are in home all day, you end up doing all kind of things in the house, and its time consuming lol.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, at first I started with some free online courses in SQL and programming logic and HTML. I also studyied a little about tests, because I had no clue how to get in the tecnology area. I was feeling myself very confused. </p>\n\n<p>Thanks God, I dont know how I found an article in medium about Free Code Camp, and I loved it. It was september , 27, coincidently, my birthday, and I started immediatly studying it.</p>\n\n<p>From 3 weeks to now, while I was listening to a brazilian front-end podcast, I figured out that I was kind of ready to apply to jr front end roles. So I started to look around some opportunities in my region.<br>And this was very fast for me, I applied for about 20 front end jobs. But all of them was asking for experience. But there where 2 of them that weren't. <br>This 2 are publicity agencies, and they called me back to set an interview. Both agencies asked me to take a PSD and code in HTML, CSS and JS, and I made this two in one week. And one of them hired me =D. The other agency did not respond yet, but I will stay with the first one because it's near my home. </p>\n\n<p>I actually am at Wikipedia Viewer, in  FCC. </p>\n\n<p>Now I'll wait my first salary to buy some cool stuff in FCC shop, as gratitude. =)</p>\n\n<p>Feel free to ask me any questions.

No college or university degrees. A couple months ago I did this post <a href=\"https://forum.freecodecamp.org/t/one-year-of-fcc-gave-me-my-first-job-as-a-front-end-developer\">https://forum.freecodecamp.org/t/one-year-of-fcc-gave-me-my-first-job-as-a-front-end-developer</a> telling a little bit about my prospects after a long journey studying programming from free resources on the internet.</p>\n<p>Now I\u2019m part of the self taught professionals team and its a shame to state that we are at a great disadvantage. Not only by the numbers(the vast majority working on this field are graduated people), but we\u2019re losing in opportunities too.</p>\n<p>I don\u2019t blame my IT friend for that statement.<br>\nHe\u2019s just expecting a better payment for his \u2018plus\u2019. The industry have been conditioning us on that way for a long time: certificates and diplomas can prove that your are better. It\u2019s a ticket to the upper level. I understand that though.</p>\n<p>Back then things were a lot more restricted. information didn\u2019t flow around for free like nowdays.<br>\nI just don\u2019t get why we can keep accepting this kind of mentality with the internet all over the place.</p>\n<p>I\u2019m not some subclass of employee just because my resources aren\u2019t usual.<br>\nI\u2019m doing great on my current job working on lots of different Front End projects. Actually, at the moment, I\u2019m the only web front end on a team of 25 developers. People come to me to ask JS and CSS questions\u2026 But somehow it doesn\u2019t count too munch for the \u2018real world\u2019!<br>\nI don\u2019t deserve a chance to even be able to be heard on interviews? Or apply for positions where the prerequisites I already have?</p>\n<p>On top of that another detail that makes me even more upset: I\u2019am not completely uneducated in the pos- high school. I have a 80% mechanical engineer course on my history and a year of computer science. I did a lot of calculus and statistics. Still doesn\u2019t count? Nope.</p>\n<p>Now I face a new challenge: I\u2019m making 4 dollars/hours on my current job and I need to find something more rentable. If I\u2019m lucky enough I will be able to double this value in 2 or 3 years. It\u2019s pretty hard to keep up with that amount and I don\u2019t have much of a chance to make more than that without leaving the country.</p>\n<p>So here I go again: I found out that looking for abroad job without a degree in computer science (or something like that) is almost impossible!<br>\nI did a lot of applications and it\u2019s so frustrating when you are rejected because they can\u2019t risk to contact someone overseas without a degree. I got to the point where I had to offer remote assistance to show my competency on the job.  \u201cour policy don\u2019t allow it\u201d.<br>\nHow about the  \u2018CS degree or equivalent is required\u2019 - For HTML/CSS and Vue proficiency\u2026 Really?</p>\n<p>To make things a lot harder some countries, like German and Ireland, just don\u2019t let international workers apply without a degree(theres a workaround if they have years of experience in the field).</p>\n<p>I got my current job with the help of the Free Code Camp courses and a lot of online resources. I did online courses from Universities like Harvard and Princeton. I did a variety of Udemy and Udacity courses. I have a lot of personal projects on my GitHub and Codepen. I don\u2019t get why people just don\u2019t realize or don\u2019t care about how important is this experience from outside the classroom.<br>\nI need to keep moving forward I gotta pay the bills I want a better life for my little baby and I love this programming life but I need to say: some days I feel like I should had been more pragmatic about the dream of the self taught. Sure, I didn\u2019t had a lot of options but If you got some money go for a college or a University. Otherwise be prepared and look before you leap.</p>", "id": "166602", "sent": null, "link": "https://forum.freecodecamp.org/t/im-self-taught-and-i-got-the-job-but/166602.json"}, "joined": null, "likes_received": 206, "views": null, "posts_read_count": 1163, "post_count": 53, "time_read": 35776, "topic_count": 14, "likes_given": 62, "topics_entered": 122}, "chat": {"foundjob_msg": {"text": "", "id": null, "sent": null, "link": null}, "received_msgs": null, "joined": null, "rel_metric": null, "sent_msgs": null}, "fcc_projects": {"tcount": 10, "pens": {"https://codepen.io/Errec/pen/BRwgwb": {"stats": [["1,405", "Views"], ["0", "Comments"], ["4", "Hearts"]], "created_at": "\n      May 05, 2017\n    ", "title": "GitHub Themed Pomodoro Clock"}, "http://codepen.io/Errec/pen/JKppYz": {"stats": [["3,428", "Views"], ["0", "Comments"], ["14", "Hearts"]], "created_at": "\n      July 19, 2016\n    ", "title": "Personal Portfolio Webpage"}, "http://codepen.io/Errec/pen/VpXJaG": {"stats": [["1,794", "Views"], ["1", "Comments"], ["4", "Hearts"]], "created_at": "\n      March 22, 2017\n    ", "title": "2-in-1 Game : Simon and Tic-Tac-Toe"}, "http://codepen.io/Errec/full/ZprVwZ/": {"stats": [["7,565", "Views"], ["2", "Comments"], ["36", "Hearts"]], "created_at": "\n      October 17, 2016\n    ", "title": "Super Mario Weather"}, "http://codepen.io/Errec/pen/XKaPKO?editors=1100": {"stats": [["209", "Views"], ["0", "Comments"], ["Hearts"]], "created_at": "\n      July 07, 2016\n    ", "title": "Tribute Page - Charles Bukowski"}, "http://codepen.io/Errec/pen/MbLxOz": {"stats": [["1,973", "Views"], ["0", "Comments"], ["7", "Hearts"]], "created_at": "\n      December 19, 2016\n    ", "title": "My Twitch List"}, "http://codepen.io/Errec/pen/QKWmXG": {"stats": [["1,303", "Views"], ["0", "Comments"], ["1", "Hearts"]], "created_at": "\n      September 02, 2016\n    ", "title": "Design Quotes"}, "http://codepen.io/Errec/pen/QvWrqR": {"stats": [["1,748", "Views"], ["0", "Comments"], ["5", "Hearts"]], "created_at": "\n      April 13, 2017\n    ", "title": "DOS Style Calculator"}, "http://codepen.io/Errec/pen/PbWvrw": {"stats": [["1,217", "Views"], ["0", "Comments"], ["2", "Hearts"]], "created_at": "\n      November 20, 2016\n    ", "title": "Wikipedia Light Viewer"}}}, "github": {"following": 24, "joined": "2016-03-27T02:09:48Z", "followers": 60, "public_repos": 39, "public_gists": 16}, "presence": "fog"}, "quesurifn": {"fogcollected": false, "forum": {"foundjob_msg": {"text": "<p>I'm going to try and be concise but effective with this. </p>\n\n<p>About me: </p>\n\n<p>23 Years Old<br>No College Degree<br>Couldn't afford school (No Debt Policy / DOE Won't lend to us anyway)<br>Strong Technical Affinity<br>Sometimes Impatient with Computers<br>Dabbled with C++ at 13, Java at 17<br>Chicago Area</p>\n\n<p>What I do now: Web Developer - I am building a node project to dynamically serve product pages with a top of the line designer giving me some pretty challenging CSS tasks.

I was a salesperson without a degree that woke up a little after our Director of Sales said we may not be relevant anymore after the year 2020. He suggested Udacity's nano degree program. Needless to say the fact that a Director at a Fortune 10 company suggested something piqued my interest.</p>\n\n<p>I signed up for the program and gave it my best go. I really enjoyed it until the Javascript part went from 0 - 100. Without teaching loops, if / else and other basics, Udaicty dove right into prototype inheritance. Udacity acknowledged this hole and has since pledged an updated curriculum.</p>\n\n<p>That was frustrating so I went to Code Academy's Javascript track. After finishing up the basics, I moved on to their Angular 1.x track. After that, I felt brave enough to try and build Udacity's neighborhood maps project with knockout.js. I nearly needed hand holding to get through that knockout doesn't have a big community, and without a JSON tree, iterating through large sets of JSON is HARD. </p>\n\n<p>I used indeed to look at the skills in the area that were e needed to become a front end developer. </p>\n\n<p>The skills I came up with: </p>\n\n<p>HTML<br>CSS<br>Javascript <br>Angular or React<br>SCSS<br>Node.js</p>\n\n<p>After about 8 or 9 projects on my website, I quit my job and applied applied applied and reached out to recruiter after recruiter.

You need to convince them otherwise. </p></li>\n<li><p>You don't have jack if you don't have a portfolio</p></li>\n<li><p>Looks sell. Most recruiters wouldn't talk to me until I made my site very cosmopolitan and designer worthy even though I didn't claim to do that </p></li>\n<li><p>Linkedin is very important and making your profile \"All Star\" should be a top priority. Most of my leads came from here. </p></li>\n<li><p>Ignore Indian recruiters. They often times spam submit your resume which will render you ineligible to be interviewed wherever they submitted it for a whole year.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>-Find a mentor if you can</p>\n\n<ul><li>BUILD BUILD BUILD BUILD The more you have in your portfolio, the more likely you'll have a job soon.</li></ul>\n\n<p>-Do not list skills on you portfolio </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Resume should be cosmopolitan and designer worthy too; Avoid adding retail experience if your goal is programming</p></li>\n<li><p>Do not half-ass learning. You will need to be proficient. There will be more time, however, to learn on the job.</p></li>\n<li><p>Anybody can code. My sister took a coding class at Arizona State for her Journalism Major and is loving it. She's not a logical person at all. She's social.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>-Your ability to code well, whatever that means to you, is directly related to how much time you spend doing it</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Learning and not having a life may suck, but your life will probably suck more if you don't stay motivated and learn. After all, you're here for a reason. </p></li>\n<li><p>Try not to overthink a solution and don't be afraid to ask for help. I use stack overflow at work and Reddit a fair amount and my boss is totally okay with that. </p></li>\n<li><p>You will get frustrated many times but it will be worth it when you change careers</p></li>\n<li><p>Do something for free. You won't think of the lost money when you transition into 9-5 with good pay and benefits.</p></li>\n<li><p>Go to a Church, Temple, Mosque whatever. (Church was hugely important for networking and had many leads from there too; Maybe even over linkedin from the people I have met there)</p></li>\n<li><p>Interview well. If you're likeable and kind of still suck at coding you're more likely to get a shot than someone who isn't very nice and is pretty good at coding. </p></li>\n<li><p>Don't be afraid to act in humilty and ask for help finding a job. There was someone very kind who decided to help me and I'm not sure where I would have gotten without his encouragement.

I'm a registered nurse but personal trainer by profession. Since 2012, before I decided to become a personal trainer, I thought of studying programming and apply for a programmer position. I tried many learning resources but failed because whenever I got stuck in some topic I always think this thing is not for me.</p>\n\n<p>From 2012 to 2015, I tried html, css, javascript, php, java, python. I studied on and off. It was really hard studying on my own because there is no one to guide me what to do. Whenever I watch youtube tutorials, I understood the topic but I did not build projects.</p>\n\n<p>June 2015, I enrolled my self in an open-university for a 1 year IT course. I finished it march 2016. Unfortunately, it was all self study. and each subject lasts only 8 hours (what can you learn in 8hours?). It was a mistake. </p>\n\n<p>March 2016, I finished the IT course, resigned from my personal training job and focused on studying more (like more html,css,js,java etc).</p>\n\n<p>August 2016, I tried FCC. built the tribute page, and the portfolio page. During this time, I also enrolled in edx.org algebra class. This same month, I sent resume from an online jobs board. I thought I need a job because I don't want to be broke by december.</p>\n\n<p>Just last week, a company contacted me for an interview and I went to them the next day. I was nervous. The first interview was pretty basic (information about myself). Then test (the hard part, math, logic, advance logic, and basic algorithm on paper). Fortunately, I passed. got 3mistakes on math, 2 mistakes on logic, and perfected the advance logic, the algorithm was also good enough. For the second interview, I was asked what projects I have been doing, I just said showed them my codepen (tribute, portfolio). I also passed the third interview.</p>\n\n<p>I signed the contract two days ago and I'll be starting this coming monday. We'll be using reactjs and symfony.

Although I already had some programming and frontend development knowledge at the moment, I saw it as a good alternative to the tutorials and other courses out there. I really enjoyed the community environment and the opportunity to learn from others.</p>\n<p>Doing the frontend projects really gave me the push I needed to always keep learning and practising to get to my goal of getting a job as a developer.</p>\n<p>I applied to many many jobs, mostly through linkedin and even got to some phone interviews. My main criteria for selecting the company was to look it up to see what they did and if I was at least a bit interested I would apply (I wasn\u2019t being picky because I wanted to see if I just got a response).</p>\n<p>In January I posted something on codepen (<a href=\"https://codepen.io/kkhenriquez/pen/LxZPRW\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">link here</a>)(it no longer works because the images are externally sourced and now you need a pro account) and it appeared in reddit. Then an agency from Canada contacted me and offered me a small remote freelancing gig doing development using the Shopify platform. (I liked it a lot because I was able to work part time during the evenings and keep my current job at the time.)</p>\n<p>Fast forward to March this year, when I got my first full-time offer to be a frontend developer.</p>\n<p>For the interview for the job I have now they didn\u2019t ask me any computer science-y stuff, I think because the role is very front-end and design oriented. They asked me about the technologies I knew and they did assign me a small real-life coding exercise (designing and coding something similar to a product card).</p>\n<p>My overall viewpoint is that working on your own projects is very helpful, I think because you have to learn to solve your own problems. Even though it\u2019s very likely you find a solution to a similar problem, the process of adapting it to your own code will help cement all of that knowledge. And obviously it also helps to have projects of your own when you\u2019re looking for a job.</p>\n<p>To finish things up, I wanted to say to everyone out there having doubts that it\u2019s truly possible to become a developer if you want to, with hard work and dedication.

I can\u2019t believe it\u2019s been less than a year and I\u2019ve found a job as a webmaster/web developer.</p>\n<p>I started programming (absolute zero knowledge) in Nov 2016 here on FCC. I wasn\u2019t even sure if I\u2019d like it or be good at it, but I wanted to try it out. I was immediately interested and kept going at it. At the time, I was finishing my bachelor\u2019s degree in Exercise Science which I love, but my interests were changing. I was doing both, FCC and Exercise Science, even though they felt like two completely different worlds. I\u2019m sure I can combine both one day.</p>\n<p>Along the way, I supplemented my learning with other online resources and Treehouse; however, FCC was always my \u2018home base\u2019 that I could return to when things were unclear or scattered.</p>\n<p>I started getting more serious in May/June and started actually building the front-end projects. Each project seemed like a huge mountain to climb, but they were all fun and taught me so much along the way. I truly believe that the projects are the best way to learn and solidify what you\u2019ve learned. During this time building projects, I was also applying to jobs, even though I probably wasn\u2019t ready for that. I was eager lol.</p>\n<p>In late June/August, I kept looking for a development-related job and I got my portfolio looking ready. All of my projects are basic, but I was hoping it would convince employers that I have the potential to learn. [I\u2019m still working on the front-end certificate.]</p>\n<p>I applied for hundreds of jobs, probably, and never heard back from most of them. I finally got an interview for a start-up company in Sarasota, FL \u2013 I thought it went well, but I was not offered the job. I was still thankful for the interview experience.</p>\n<p>A couple of weeks later after that interview, I got the chance to interview over skype for a webmaster/ web developer position at a company in Texas. I thought I came across as inexperienced, but they seemed interested. They stated they weren\u2019t looking for remote employees and that we could talk more in person. I was considering moving there anyway, so I packed up and took the two-day drive from south Florida to Texas. There was no guarantee that I\u2019d be hired.</p>\n<p>The next day after I arrived, I met with the owner in person and he hired me! I\u2019ve worked there two days so far. I\u2019m overwhelmed, for sure, but I\u2019m so thankful I get the opportunity to do what I love and be paid to do it! I\u2019m also suffering from \u2018imposter syndrome\u2019 for sure, especially considering my inexperience and unrelated formal education, but it helps to know that a lot of others feel that way sometimes.</p>\n<p>My responsibilities include website maintenance, updating content, general IT troubleshooting, networking, and building software for other internal departments. I found out that there\u2019s so much more to learn, including PHP, visual basic, and some graphic design.</p>\n<p>I\u2019ve always wanted to write an \u201cI got a job!\u201d post, haha. Again, I\u2019m so thankful to the FCC community.<br>\nI\u2019m going to continue FCC, of course, in addition to learning other languages I need for the new job.<br>\nThere\u2019s also a lot more meetup groups here in Texas (compared to Florida), so I\u2019m excited for those too.</p>\n<p>At times, it felt like this day would never come, but if you continue to work towards your goals, it\u2019s inevitable that you\u2019ll reach them!</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Jon</li>\n</ul>", "id": "141347", "sent": null, "link": "https://forum.freecodecamp.org/t/got-my-first-dev-job-in-less-than-a-year/141347.json"}, "joined": null, "likes_received": 63, "views": null, "posts_read_count": 1056, "post_count": 6, "time_read": 23197, "topic_count": 1, "likes_given": 23, "topics_entered": 142}, "chat": {"foundjob_msg": {"text": "", "id": null, "sent": null, "link": null}, "received_msgs": null, "joined": null, "rel_metric": null, "sent_msgs": null}, "fcc_projects": {"tcount": 8, "pens": {"https://codepen.io/jon-0/full/BdEpyB/": {"stats": [["7", "Views"], ["0", "Comments"], ["Hearts"]], "created_at": "\n      September 05, 2017\n    ", "title": "Javascript Calculator"}, "https://codepen.io/jon-0/full/JJGYRQ/": {"stats": [["122", "Views"], ["0", "Comments"], ["Hearts"]], "created_at": "\n      June 08, 2017\n    ", "title": "Random Quote Machine"}, "https://codepen.io/jon-0/full/qjqpQe/": {"stats": [["107", "Views"], ["0", "Comments"], ["Hearts"]], "created_at": "\n      June 15, 2017\n    ", "title": "Wikipedia Viewer"}, "http://codepen.io/jon-0/pen/QGNJqR": {"stats": [], "created_at": null, "title": ""}}}, "github": {"following": 2, "joined": "2016-11-10T17:04:10Z", "followers": 3, "public_repos": 10, "public_gists": 0}, "presence": "fog"}, "aidansven": {"fogcollected": false, "forum": {"foundjob_msg": {"text": "<p>Just finished my daily scrum meeting\u2026 I LOVE BEING A DEV</p>\n<p>This is a follow up to my last post - <a href=\"https://forum.freecodecamp.com/t/just-had-my-first-interview/117791\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Just had my First Interview</a> - I actually just started my first developer job a few days ago! Building all of the freeCodeCamp projects definitely gave me the skills to do a mid-level developer job. FCC teaches you how to think critically and work situations out in your mind, which is exactly what defines a good developer, and something that tutorials and videos can\u2019t teach.</p>\n<p>-I Started freeCodeCamp in May 2016<br>\n-Finished all three certifications two weeks ago<br>\n-I was in communication with Michael about starting a nonprofit project to help my resume but it turns out I didn\u2019t even need it!</p>\n<p>Last month, I left my IT support job and moved to a tech hub city thinking it would be easy to get a dev job there. I was wrong. So many jrs are moving here and so many bootcamp grads are flooding the market with jrs. After applying for at least 300 jobs online through indeed, going to tech fairs, and communicating with recruiters, I had no success. I landed a few phone screens and interviews, but never got an offer. I realized applying via indeed was a wasted effort. But then\u2026</p>\n<p>Out of the desperation of running out of money, I posted an ad in the \u201cresumes\u201d section on craigslist, and just wrote a brief bio and linked to my portfolio. Within 24 hours a Software Architect contacted me and asked me to come in, and he gave me the project details on the spot - not even a coding interview, we just discussed the high level details of the project.</p>\n<p>I am now working on contract for an IT solutions company, building an application for a large international phone / communications company, making (alot - for me - rhymes with 35) per hour. This week I\u2019ve been working closely with the Scrum Master to talk with the client, understand the requirements, make mockups/user stories, and list the apis\u2026 I will be working with the front end team, doing more facilitating than actual coding (at least so far). I\u2019ve been told by my managers I\u2019m doing really great work, and my coworkers think that I\u2019m a very experienced dev - and in a way I am because freeCodeCamp hands-down produces the best quality students to those who put in the effort and stick with it to the end!</p>\n<p>You can probably start applying way earlier than I did in most cities, and land a jr dev job. In the tech hubs there\u2019s a lot of competition amongst jrs, so jr. dev jobs are hard to get. I was excited to do a non-profit project for FCC but Michael encouraged me to focus on my full-time job now, as I have a lot of techs to learn.</p>\n<p>The biggest things that I want you to know are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>You can become a solid developer, and you don\u2019t even need to finish FCC to do it</li>\n<li>Unfortunately, a freeCodeCamp education on your resume won\u2019t be able to prove to recruiters or HR people that you know your stuff, so applying to jobs online is completely worthless</li>\n<li>Do some remote freelance work - I did a few projects on upwork, which I was able to add to my resume</li>\n<li>Again - recruiters and HR are not interested in freeCodeCamp students in the least, even though they are missing out on a world class catch (you!). Find a way to bypass them to get your dream job.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Things that are a waste of time:<br>\nindeed, ziprecruiter, indeed, monster, indeed, any other job board site, indeed, direct online applications with companies, indeed, etc.</p>\n<p>Things that got me a good ratio of phone screens/interviews (maybe 15%):<br>\nAngelList (<a href=\"http://angel.co\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">angel.co</a>) - the platform built for startups<br>\nCraigslist Jobs</p>\n<p>Other things to consider: <a href=\"http://hired.com\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">hired.com</a> - I know one fcc student was able to get a job through hired, but you would definitely need to supplement freeCodeCamp with other projects or classes and usually years of experience to qualify.

Didn\u2019t get it, felt bad, but it was a learning experience.</li>\n<li>Moved to north California in February to be close to my parents.</li>\n<li>Started coding intensely since I was unemployed. Kept applying to jobs with no luck.</li>\n<li>Finished all the FCC certificates by March 2017.</li>\n<li>Wasn\u2019t sure what to do next (need more FCC!), so I started reading \u2018You Don\u2019t Know JavaScript\u2019.</li>\n<li>Was surprised to get an email from a prospective employer for a phone interview in April.</li>\n<li>Did a php coding test as part of the interview process. Intensely learned php while working on the coding test. Got the in-person interview.</li>\n<li>In-person interview was more of a culture fit check since my coding test and github projects were enough evidence that I could code and had potential to get better.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>So the takeaways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I actually got a job through <a href=\"http://Indeed.com\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Indeed.com</a>, and the only company that gave me a chance was one that didn\u2019t have an HR department for recruitment. The developers on the team looked at my github and they could see my passion for programming.</li>\n<li>In the interview process, your main message to the employer is: I know my stuff, I am a fast learner, I am a lifelong learner, I am passionate about programming and I have no doubt that I want to make it my career. Keep that in mind, and ask/answer questions accordingly.</li>\n<li>The interview process is you interviewing the employer as well. Make sure the job is good for a junior developer. Ask questions like: \u201cWho do I go to for help? How am I evaluated? What opportunities are there for learning? How much of my day will be spent on coding? Who are the people I will be communicating with the most?\u201d</li>\n<li>There\u2019s a lot of stories of people coding for a couple of months and then getting a job. Well, I took a lot longer. If you count the time from when I first took a community college intro to programming class, it\u2019s been about 5 years since I began learning. Why so slow? For one, I was working a full-time job the entire time. Two, I didn\u2019t do much coding between the time I first started and when I found FCC.

I did a diploma of professional studies(not sure it\u2019s a thing outside of where I live) to become an IT tech and there was a html/css/php class and decided it was what I wanted to do instead of repairing computers. I did an internship in a little startup(they were 4 people) for a month. They mainly make wordpress and shopify website. I made an adwords script for them even though I was the only developer and had no idea what adwords was before starting. I also helped with other technical stuff they couldn\u2019t fix on the websites they were working on. I spent most of the time reading the adwords script documentation and trying things that didn\u2019t work, but managed to get it done faster then they thought I would. They were actually really happy with what I did and called me 2 months after my DPS for a job!</p>\n<p>Now I\u2019ve been working there for 5 months and I am really happy with the job(it\u2019s actually my first job ever!), but I need speak with my boss about my salary. I\u2019m currently making 300$ CAD per week which is not a lot, but I have a very flexible work schedule. Since lately I\u2019ve been working 2-3 days a week + some days at home when there\u2019s some emergency. So it was actually ok, but lately I\u2019m working a little bit more. I know I should speak with him about that and I\u2019m sure it won\u2019t be a problem, but I\u2019m not sure what a basic salary for a junior web developer without much experience or any big studies should be. Anyone could help me with that?</p>\n<p>Also, I\u2019m making a shopify app for them which they think will bring a lot of money. I\u2019m the only one coding it since I\u2019m the only developer. They give me their ideas of what they want the app to be, and I code them. The designer will soon give me a model(not sure what I should call this, like just an image of what the app should look like) that I\u2019ll do my best to translate to css. My boss is offering me 10% of the profit from the app, but I\u2019m not sure if I should be content with this since I\u2019m the only one making most of the job on this project. Should I ask for more or should I be happy he\u2019s offering me this?</p>\n<p>I\u2019m a little stressed about all this, they feel like good people, I feel like I have a good relation with them and I\u2019d be happy to work with them for a long time, but I don\u2019t want to get tricked.

This came after a year of self study and training-no boot camp or other formal training. I have been meaning to write this post for a while, but thanks to being employed full time at a new job I haven\u2019t gotten around to it before now.</p>\n<p>I don\u2019t want to write a long post, as I think there is plenty of great advice on the forum, but would rather just share what I think are the most important lessons I learned.</p>\n<h2>Give it time</h2>\n<p>I originally thought I would get a job after 3 months, then after 6, but it took me a little more than a year. Don\u2019t expect instant results, this process is going to take time. I eventually ended up working a couple of hourly jobs at 55 hours/week to make ends meet while I studied.</p>\n<h2>Stick with things</h2>\n<p>It\u2019s really easy to want to jump from language to language, or course to course, or from one meetup group to another. Really make it a goal to finish what you start, and choose the courses/sites/group that you really like and stick with them.</p>\n<h2>Make projects or find some and contribute</h2>\n<p>By all means, you need to write your own code! Pick a project and jump in and make it! Don\u2019t worry if it\u2019s been done a million times or you think it\u2019s not that fancy. Just build stuff. Alternately, find ongoing projects and contribute to them. I worked with a friend on his personal project and ended up with the front end of a web app that I had written completely in React. I also attended a meetup every week and contributed to an open source project. These were the two biggest examples I used when interviewing.</p>\n<h2>Network!</h2>\n<p>I signed up for all the job sites like Dice, Monster, Career Builder, etc\u2026 and I also talked to many recruiters, but I was referred to the job I got by a friend. I wasn\u2019t even really applying for jobs when I interviewed. Make connections in your local developer community, be curious and interested, and be someone that others want to work with. When they have an opening, they will think of people who they want to be in the room with them every day. This matters as much as your knowledge. Show that you are self-motivated and resourceful, and that you are willing to take feedback.</p>\n<p>Best of luck, just keep learning, writing code, and be persistent!</p>", "id": "167761", "sent": null, "link": "https://forum.freecodecamp.org/t/hired-as-a-front-end-dev/167761.json"}, "joined": null, "likes_received": 93, "views": null, "posts_read_count": 3762, "post_count": 34, "time_read": 93459, "topic_count": 3, "likes_given": 56, "topics_entered": 451}, "chat": {"foundjob_msg": {"text": "", "id": null, "sent": null, "link": null}, "received_msgs": null, "joined": null, "rel_metric": null, "sent_msgs": null}, "fcc_projects": {"tcount": 10, "pens": {"https://codepen.io/robgaston/pen/rWyvwE": {"stats": [["108", "Views"], ["0", "Comments"], ["Hearts"]], "created_at": "\n      November 21, 2016\n    ", "title": "Pomodoro"}, "https://codepen.io/robgaston/pen/pNVYGL": {"stats": [["84", "Views"], ["0", "Comments"], ["Hearts"]], "created_at": "\n      December 07, 2016\n    ", "title": "Tic Tac Toe"}, "https://codepen.io/robgaston/pen/VKGOYV?editors=1010": {"stats": [["96", "Views"], ["0", "Comments"], ["Hearts"]], "created_at": "\n      October 17, 2016\n    ", "title": "Wiki Search"}}}, "github": {"following": 0, "joined": "2016-09-29T02:47:15Z", "followers": 1, "public_repos": 29, "public_gists": 0}, "presence": "cfog"}, "odrisck": {"fogcollected": false, "forum": {"foundjob_msg": {"text": "", "id": null, "sent": null, "link": null}, "joined": null, "likes_received": null, "views": null, "posts_read_count": null, "post_count": null, "time_read": null, "topic_count": null, "likes_given": null, "topics_entered": null}, "chat": {"foundjob_msg": {"text": "", "id": null, "sent": null, "link": null}, "received_msgs": null, "joined": null, "rel_metric": null, "sent_msgs": null}, "fcc_projects": {"tcount": null, "pens": {}}, "github": {"following": 34, "joined": "2014-10-12T03:44:54Z", "followers": 52, "public_repos": 40, "public_gists": 0}, "presence": "cg"}}
