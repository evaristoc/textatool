( church be enormously important for networking and have many lead from there excessively ; possibly even over linkedin from the people i have meet there ) interview well . if you 're likeable and kind of still suck at cod you 're more likely to get a shot than someone who be n't very nice and be reasonably good at cod . do n't be afraid to act in humilty and ask for help find a job . there be someone very kind who decide to help me and i 'm not sure where i would have get without his encouragement . at time i stuggled with all of this emotionally ( and technically ) . resource : http : //frontendhandbook.com code academy udacity - least favorite for learn - very cool project linkedin fcc forum ( thank you ! ) tyler mcginnis ( or something like that ) do a great video on react , so do egghead.io egghead.io other tip : css be best learned and tweak in dev tool first always use json tree for view json copying code will about always trip you up ( ymmv ) try to use a plugin or library if one exist . make sure someone update it recently and have update it several time in the past try to pay attention to all of the little nuance to javascript . if you think through the code line by line and why and how it 's do that , you 'll learn much quicker . you will run into thing at work even that be difficult and need time to find a solution . there will be enough of google when you find a job i 'm not sure what i 'm miss . ask me anything and i 'll find time to respond . p.s . i 'm highlight the fact i 'm in chicago because i feel like there be few american case here and everything change base off of locaton .\",\n",

'' that be my trigger to teach myself html and css and because of these skill i get a job as webmaster for a trading company , i do n't touch cod at all because the company 's website be use wordpress . after 4 year work as worpress webmaster ( still teach excessively ) , i decide to switch career as web developer , but i do n't know where should i begin . out of nowhere as universe listen my dream , some link about codehour ( hadi partovi ) bring me to another link , i end up watch youtube video about program why our kid must learn to code and it make me enrol to codecademy and subsequently in freecodecamp . i spend a year try to figure out javascript puzzle in fcc as english be not my mother tongue , but i keep repeat it and finally understood how javascript work , but i still have to learn it more deeply.at this time i besides fell in love with rail and try to follow all tutorial about clone web apps with rails.i be still at front-end intermediate project but all the puzzle i 've pass , build a stronger basic front-end skill for me . as i 'm 33 year old now , i have the urge to get a developer job equally soon as possible , so i apply to many front-end job vacancy , surprisingly i get many interview invitation despite i do n't have it degree , merely personal rail project in github and freecodecamp project and compete with younger developer with experience or fresh graduate that agree with entry level salary . i merely believe in law of attraction that if i have passion universe will open door for me , some interview make me loose confidence , as one interviewer underestimate me by say that i 'm a late gamer , excessively old to apply for developer job , it be very uncomfortable moment , i lose my confidence , but one article about age issue in apply developer job , make me confidence , because the article say if the interviewer say that to you , it mean he be look for fresh graduate that be willing to receive low starter salary . i decide not to give up and keep send resume , surprisingly one great startup in my city invite me to get an interview . i have nothing to loose so i do my best in the interview and 2 week subsequently i get accept and they offer me experienced ( mid-career ) developer salary . i keep wonder until now , why they offer me this job , possibly i guess they consider my passion in learn programming , and i owe big thanks to fcc for give me strong foundation in front-end skill . thanks fcc\",\n",

( i 'm start on monday and i 'm truly nervous , so wish me luck ! ) update : it 's be a week since i start , and so far it 's go perfect ! i be truly overwhelm at first , because work on a part of a huge project ( my company build a learning platform for kid ) be very different from build a web page or an applet on codepen on your own ; besides my company use a framework of their own design , which be powerful , but truly hard to learn , and we write in coffeescript alternatively of plain js , so i 'm still adjust to that . besides i be n't truly comfortable with git , but i be now , after about lose 8-hours worth of code do n't be like me , learn git . but all in all , i be n't sure cod be something i can actually do for a living till i start work , but now i 'm very happy ! thank you all for wish me luck , and do find me on linkedin or github if you wan na ask something or merely chat !\",\n",
       " \"i 've be look forward to write a post like this for a long time . this monday , i 'll be start my new job as a software engineer ! i have an outline for a detailed blog post about how i get to this point , but for now , i want to share some actionable advice to help you get that elusive first developer job . do n't rush yourself i 've see a lot of internet writing about people who 've go from no exposure to cod to a hire developer within 6 month . realize that those people be the unicorn . be happy for them , but realize it will probably take you at least a year if you have a full time job . i 'd spend over two year work through free code camp off and on before i get to a level where company want to talk to me . do n't think of it as a competition for job against other developer where if you move excessively slow , you 'll get leave behind . there be more job opening out there than you could ever hope to apply to . once you get good at building application , company will be enthusiastic about get you in for an interview because there merely be n't many people at that level who be n't already work for another company . it 's not a race . once you 're ready , company will want to hire you . i promise . when be you ready ? when it come to learn to code , i like to think of it like learn to climb a mountain . before even reach base camp , you need to learn about what gear you 'll need , how each piece work , and how all the piece work together . then , you need to practice use your gear until you 're comfortable . then , you need to learn to climb . you 'll possibly start on some boulder , then steep hill , then some short peak , and keep building up skill from there . over time , you 'll encounter obstacle you 've never face before and gain experience and priceless lesson from failure and frustration . the key be to merely keep go . learn from your failure , and move on . do , fail , learn , repeat . finally , it get easier and easier , and you can attempt to summit larger and larger mountain . relate that fun metaphor to code , if you 're start from zero experience , you 'll need to get comfortable with your gear ( command line , text editor , git , http , productivity tool ) , then learn to climb ( html , css , javascript ) , and finally scale larger and larger rock , hill , peak , and mountain . ( build more and more complex application ) . can you summit a “fourteener” after 6 month ? it 's possible , but it 'll be far safer and easier to get very comfortable with all of the aspect of mountain climbing ( build application ) first . once you 've gain some experience through building many project , and have build a number of larger , complex application that reach and extend your limit , company will see that and desire that same work for their product . kill imposter syndrome do n't waste time with thought like “i ca n't get this to work , i must suck at this.” or “i 'll never be a developer at this rate” or “everyone be so much better than me” . do n't waste precious time doubt yourself , or compare yourself or your progress with others . the only metric that matter be this : “did i learn something today ? ” if that answer be “yes” , you win . period . it do n't matter if your code be still break , or if you 're still confuse about a concept . learn to program computer be hard . you wo n't get certain thing right away . it may take a few day , week , or even month to understand certain concept or technology . that 's normal . equally long as you 've learn something today that you do n't know yesterday , you 're move in the right direction . merely imagine multiply that new knowledge you learn today time 365 or 730 . those lesson add up fast . if you 're learn , you 're win . it 's hard to see in the moment , but if you do n't believe me , merely look at the code you 've produce last month ( or even last week ) . if you find yourself cringe at certain line , pat yourself on the back . you 've get better at it ! over time , those mini-lessons will add up to you become a developer that will be capable of bring real value to company and customer . if you learn new thing and practice everyday , it will truly merely be a matter of time before company will want to hire you , no matter who you be or where you 've start from . when be you ready to apply for job ? in my personal experience , i begin get call for interview after i finish my first full-stack application for free code camp , the voting application . by that point , i 'd complete my front end certification , finish all of the api project , and be ready to work through the remain dynamic web application project . after finish the voting app , i decide to build a boilerplate to assist myself and others in bootstrapping the rest of the dynamic web application project with a modern stack center around the react ecosystem . get it here : https : //github.com/mtrifilo/react-ssr-boilerplate the boilerplate offer a starting point with react , redux , react router 4 , webpack , express , mongodb , and a json web token authentication strategy with local auth and oauth with github . i strongly encourage you to learn each of those technology individually before dive in , otherwise you 'll hit a brick wall reasonably quickly . frontend master offer course on everything i use for the boilerplate , and the subscription be well worth the $ 39 a month . you do n't need to use react if you do n't want to . plenty of company use vue , angular , ember , or even custom build front end framework . the important thing be that you get comfortable and proficient in at least one popular framework . they all exist for the same objective : to offer a scalable way to build client side application . once you get comfortable with one of them , you can learn the others reasonably quickly . at this point in 2017 , the most popular major framework have embrace component as first class citizen , offer helpful cli tool , have great documentation , large community , and great debugging tool . you truly ca n't go wrong with any framework these day . they each have their trade-off and frustration point , but if you learn them well , they 'll take you very far . so , when be you ready to apply for job ? my simple answer : when you be capable of build a simple full stack application , and can provide plenty of code sample on github that show consistent improvement . if you 're not comfortable with git and github , do yourself a huge favor and spend some time on it . it will help you vastly . use github as version control for your free code camp project , and other personal project , will allow potential employer to read through your commits and watch you progress in real time . do n't be shy ! if they like what they see in your code , they will be much more confident in want to hire you than they would be otherwise . you want your potential employer to have a good idea that you 'd be a great fit for the role before you even walk in for the interview . open source all of your project will give good company the evidence and confidence they need to be sure that you 're most likely perfect for the role they need to fill . merely do it ! apply for job one downright lie that i 've see all over the web be the idea that job site be worthless for get your first developer job . absolutely false ! i 've have a number of interview from company i 've apply to through glassdoor.com , and that 's besides where i find my current company . in many case , company will post ad on many different job site that all link to the same job application either on the company 's website , or a service like jobvite . it 's a grind , do n't get me wrong , but if you can get one interview for every 20 application , it 's worth it . if you 're apply to more than 20 company without even a phone call , do n't take it personally . there 's likely a reason you 're be pass for other candidate . revisit your resume , cover letter , and how you 're present your portfolio . google yourself . look at how you 're present yourself through the lense of a hiring manager . create a “funnel of success” so that company visit any of your portfolio page will be guide to the best of what you have to offer . if you 've get far enough through free code camp to be ready to apply for job , then you already have plenty of apps to showcase . if they be n't open source , put them on github . hire manager will vet you . they 'll look at your code on github , they 'll look through your tweet , they 'll read your blog . give them something to get excite about ! do n't bend your internet life so it look good for company , but at the very least , have some recent project on github to prove you know what you 're do , and make sure there be nothing offensive on your public social medium account that may raise doubt about whether you 'd follow company policy or code of conduct . do n't get discourage if you apply to 30 or 40 company without any interview . it take hard work and practice to get your resume , cover letter , and portfolio polish to the point of get the attention of employer . even if you 're the best candidate for the job , employer will normally throw your resume in the trash if it have spelling error , grammar mistake , a headshot ( do n't include a picture , ever ! it expose company to potential legal trouble if they contact you , so they wo n't ) , or lie . resume i think it 's safe to say that everyone hat resume . candidate , hr people , manager , probably you . unless you 're go to do something very unique and fun with it , merely keep your resume as clean and simple as possible . do n't worry approximately fancy garnish or flashy font . if the fluff make your resume harder to parse in 10 second , that will work against you . a boring , but clear , concise , and readable resume will elicit a mental “thank you for make my job easier” from every manager who read it . its purpose be to communicate essential information about a candidate to manager equally quickly as possible . a hiring manager will merely devote a few second to read your resume , so keep the most important thing front and center . make you contact information available , and easy to see quickly . include your phone number , email address and github profile address at the very least . offer a “summary” section that will be your elevator speech . a few sentence each of who you be , what you 've do , and what you can do to make the company more successful . this might need a few revision over time . mine surely do . after the summary , add section for closely related work experience , some project that showcase the best of what you 've build ( with a short description , and link to a live demos and source code of course ) , technology you 're proficient in , and education . order each section base on most impressive to least impressive , but keep the summary at the top so at least that will get read . for the technology section , you 'll want the resume scanner to bring you up if a manager be look for a reference to word like “javascript” or “leftpad” . do n't be tempt to list everything you 've ever play with for 5 minute . merely list a technology if you 've actually use it in a larger project , and can back up the claim with actual code that prove that you know how to use it efficaciously . if you want to learn something like webpack or sass , spend a few day build a challenging , non-trivial project with the technology you 're learn , and use github for version control . merely like that , you can put it on your resume ! if it 's a new language or framework , you 'll need to devote more time to learning and building project with the new thing . that come back to the importance of get very comfortable with one language and framework first . once you 're good at one , you can pick up others much quicker . use that code-fu to your advantage . the take-away be , merely include technology you can back up with actual code . excessively many people include tech that they 've merely use in a small codepen project , or even have merely read about . if you ca n't back it up with real code , leave it out . good manager can pick up on unrealistic boast very quickly . they 're vet you , remember ? no one expect you to know all of the hip technology . merely be honest and open about what you know and do n't know , and demonstrate that you 're excite to learn new thing whenever necessary . education have vary importance depend on the company . some will merely talk to you if you have a cs degree . others wo n't care if you go to college at all equally long as you can prove that you can build software . if you 've earn a degree for anything other than computer science , try to include any impressive accomplishment like a high gpa , or and extra curricular accomplishment . after all of that , do n't obsess excessively much about your resume . your code and your project will speak much louder . merely make sure you 're wholly honest , but highlight what make you the candidate they should hire . ( hint : you have awesome project you can showcase ! ) . be sure to have a friend , your so , your mom , or a recruiter pal read your resume to ensure there be no spelling error or grammatical error . take their advice with gratitude , but with healthy skepticism unless they have experience in recruiting or hiring developer specifically . i 'm not an expert either . trial and error will reveal what work over time . cover letter merely write them . if you 're apply to so many company that it 's become a real issue to write cover letter , something else be probably disqualify you in the eye of employer . it take time , it 's annoy , but it will besides get the attention of the employer out there that do care about cover letter . there be a lot of company that take cover letter seriously , and may interview you merely because you care enough about the role to take the time to write a personal cover letter while the other 30 candidate merely give them cookie-cutter resume . if this will be your first job relate to software development , a cover letter be your chance to explain why you 're go to be amaze for the role , and what project you 've do that prove that you 'll be a great addition to the development team . surely , a lot of company do n't read cover letter anymore , but the one that do be the one that take them seriously , and that 's one more way to set yourself apart from the hundred of other candidate mass-applying to every company they see without even remember the company 's name . it 's easier to get to the top of the resume pile than you might think if you 're willing to put in some extra effort . it help to write a generic cover letter so that you do n't have to write the same basic information over and over again , but most of each cover letter should be unique to each company . it truly do n't take much time after you write a few . you have a lot to gain from take the extra time . the grind be real the hard truth be if you do n't have any related work experience and your resume land on the desk of an hr rep , it 's probably go in the trash . it do n't matter if you invent the next webpack . many hr people be n't technical ( and why should they be ? ) so they 'll merely pick the candidate that be most likely to be hirable base on work experience . if you have no work experience , your profile wo n't even be look at by anyone technical , and your resume will go directly into the trash . i 've hear this call the hr firewall . it 's their loss . the company you want to work for will care more about your actual code and what you can actually do right now than your previous work experience . if you can prove you can produce great result with modern technology , and can show that you 're very well verse in either javascript , python , php , java , or others , lack of work experience wo n't matter equally much and you 'll probably at least get call for an interview . skilled developer be in high demand , and company do n't necessarily care about where they come from , equally long as they can do the job well . so how do you find these company ? how do you get your resume from the hr office to the desk of the software engineering manager who will actually look at your code ? the fastest way be through networking . this be n't mandatory , but it surely help a lot . network one of the fastest way to get your resume to the top of the pile be to contact a hiring manager directly , and bypass the company 's career page wholly . you should n't spam people you 've never meet , but if you go to a meetup where a local company be present something cool they 're work on , be in attendance . oftentimes , they 'll mention that they 're hire and encourage anyone in attendance to email a manager at the company directly if they 're interested in work for them . that email address could fast-track you to an interview if you 'd be a good candidate . you 'll besides have the oppurtunity to talk shop with experienced developer you would n't normally meet day to day . on the first of every month , hacker news host a “who 's hiring” thread , which quickly fill up with dozen of post by company hire developer . use your browser 's search feature to find the job you want . some company will provide an email address to a manager who will take a look at your resume and portfolio . when send a resume to someone via email , treat the body of the email as your cover letter . “networking” have all sort of groan-inducing connotation , but it 's very simple . merely talk to people with shared interest . there be a lot of amaze development community full of people who like to geek out about tech . do n't go ask people “hey , be you hire ? ” , but if you merely talk to people about cool thing you 're work on that you 're excite about , and cool thing they 're work on that they 're excite about , the people who be hire will find you in those situation . people know people , and they talk to each other . worst case scenario , you 'll meet nice people , have some free pizza , hear a talk about something you 're interested in , and learn some new thing . the horror . interview interview be stressful . there 's no way around it . you merely have to go through it and realize that no matter what happen , you 'll always feel better when it 's do . it 's good for you . thankfully , the people who be interview you will more than probably be very nice , welcoming , and root for your success . if they act cold or condescend towards you , take that as a red flag against the company . remember , you 're interview them , excessively . be this a company you 'd want to work for ? the process normally start with a phone screening , which be a 10-20 minute conversation about the position , what they 're look for , your experience , and what you 're look for . if the recruiter think you could be a contending candidate for the position , and your experience and objective match what the company be look for , on paper at least , you 'll move on to the next step . this be where company vary widely . you could get a take-home project to work on for a few hour and turn in , or you could be invite to pair-program with a developer , with you in the driver 's seat , and build a small project . you could get both test . for both take-homes , and pair-programming challenge , the interviewer will probably give you the freedom to pick any library or framework you 'd like to build the project . cool , that mean you can merely use react because it 's the hip thing , and you 're truly good at it , right ? you can , but take a step back and think for a moment . if you 're task be to build , say , a stop watch with a lap counting feature , be react truly necessary ? think of the pro and con to bring in the library . it will make the code more organized , but it 's a small project which wo n't be grow or scale after it 's do . you can use the revealing-module pattern to keep thing clean and encapsulate . react be easy to use , but it require more time and boilerplate to set up vs. vanilla javascript . react be reasonably lightweight , but it still will add weight to the page that might not be necessary at all if you merely use custom design pattern with vanilla javascript . react offer great performance for manipulate the dom , but this app wo n't be do any expensive dom manipulation . be react fun and a joy to work with ? yes . the company be use react in production so should you use react in the challenge ? merely if it 's require , or the best solution to the problem . in the case of the stop watch app , react be not the best solution to the problem . it 's a small app with simple , predictable dom manipulation , and it will not need to scale at all once it 's finish . react be not necessary in this case . it 's easy to think that you 'll be judge base on finish the coding challenge , and deliver a working solution , but that be merely part of what you 're be judge on . i think i fail my first pair-programming challenge in spectacular fashion . i do n't come near to finish the small app i be task to build , and i have to look up a lot of basic dom api method on the mdn . even so , i make it to the next round of interview . why ? i ca n't know for sure , but i can speculate that there be a few reason . first away , the interviewer be look at how i approach the problem . would i reach for the framework i 'm most comfortable with instinctively ? or would i use the best solution to the problem at hand , even if i 'm less comfortable with it ? i end up scaffold out the application with vanilla javascript , even though i 'm terrible with the native dom api 's , and have to look up method all the time . importantly , i demonstrate that i know where and how to look up the method i need as i need them . it be slow go , and i make a lot of mistake , but i keep my cool , and work through the problem one step at a time , talk through it every step of the way . we run out of time before i get any of the main feature do , but the main purpose of the interview be n't about finish the app . it be about get a sense of how i approach new problem . the interviewer mention subsequently that i be work on build the actual app while other candidate who choose react be still set up the boilerplate . i make the right call . one thing to emphasize , vocalize your thinking always while pair-programming in an interview setting . the point of the interview be to see how you approach problem , and they ca n't read mind . talk through what you 're do . this might seem a bit awkward at first , but merely practice by pair-programming with friend or other free code camper , or even merely talk through the process on your own to get comfortable with it . the next phase after the initial take-home/pair-programming session be normally an on-site interview , though every company be different . at the on-site interview , you 'll by_and_large spend the day at the company get to know potential teammate and manager , and have a series of interview throughout the day . some of them may be one-on-one , others may be with a group . some will surely be technical , others will be more culture-fit type interview . the technical interview may include the dreaded white board question , but many company do n't use white board anymore . if you 're interview with company like google or facebook , count on white board question . at this phase in the technical interview , you 'll very likely get some question about data structure and/or algorithms and will be expect to implement a couple . do n't panic ! if you spend a week or two learning or practice the common data structure and algorithms , you should get to basic level of knowledge where you can implement some simple challenge . for a first programming job , you wo n't be give the sort of brain-meltingly difficult cs question that senior developer get . you 'll get there someday . for you 're first program job , you 'll be expect to demonstrate that you at least understand how the basic data structure and algorithms work , what bigo notation be , and why time/space complexity be important . you 'll besides be ask to implement at least one data structure or algorithm in some way . algorithms and data structure be intimidate at first , but they merely take practice . if you make it through pre-calculus in high school , you can handle algorithms and data structure . the important thing be to be able to implement them on your own base on write requirement or very generic pseudocode . do n't merely memorize them ! the skillset you want to develop be the ability to implement them yourself . if you can do that , your interviewer can give you any task to build out , and you 'll be able to figure it out on your own . that be a hard , hard skill to develop , and it will hurt your brain and take a lot of time to master . senior developer make the big dollar for a reason . do n't get discourage . merely keep practice implement the common algorithms and data structure , and try out some related interview challenge question . over time , you 'll get better and better at it . it will be hard , but do n't quit ! for your first development role , you wo n't be expect to know how to implement every data structure and algorithm ( your interviewer wo n't know all of them , either ) , so be very open and honest about what you know and do n't know . no matter what question or problem they present you with , give it your very best shot . do n't worry about how you 're do , or what they might be think of how you 're do . focus 100 % of your attention on the problem at hand . if you have n't learn link list yet , but be very familiar with stack and queue , mention it ! they might give you a question about stack and queue alternatively , and you 'll be much more prepared to nail the challenge . if you can get proficient with stack and queue , they know that you can learn link list . the most important thing to demonstrate when it come to algorithms and data structure be that you understand what bigo notation be , and its importance . write a piece of code that be o ( n^2 ) , that could have be o ( n ) , cost real money and cpu cycle in production . prove to them that you wo n't do such a thing . takeaway whether or not a company hire you be largely outside of your control . put your best self forward always , and make learning and gain experience your primary objective while interview . every interview will be a challenge that will teach you a few thing , and you 'll get better and better at it over time . try not to worry excessively much about whether a certain company hire you or not . every interview will get you that much closer to get an offer from one company or another . their will always be another company that will want to interview . if you get reject , learn what you can from it and move on . get comfortable with failure . i 've gain many priceless lesson from the moment i 've fail interview or code challenge . you ca n't get those kind of lesson any other way , and reasonably much any good developer you 'll talk to will have similar story . it 's part of the journey . if you can reframe the idea of failure into a oppurtunity to learn something you could n't learn any other way , failure take on a whole different significance . i 've hear the adage ( dreadfully butcher ) : “you either win , or you learn . the only way to lose be to quit.” if you focus on get better at coding and interviewing every day , you 're win . that 's it . period . you can have an interview a day , and get reject every day for a month , but if you 're get better and better each and every day , there will be a point where you 'll

       " \"hi all , i start free code camp over a year and a bit ago now , and it have be a great way for me to become an active coder . through my interest of free code camp , i find myself become interested in many other program language like python , clojure and c # , give me a better idea of the utility of all the programming language . this be the story of how i get my first web development role this week . around the latter half of last year and the begging of this year , i have be work in temporary job , normally last about 6 week each , but i make sure i be get into non-customer base office work , like data entry for example , merely so i be use computer , on the off-chance i would be hand a computer that be off the reign , and could express myself by write code . in february this year , that strategy pay away . after a few dud job ( i.e . archaic infrastructure and regressive business ethos ) , i be finally employ by a small team of approximately seven , who be part of a large international parent company . the head of the team give me a task of acquire data from website manually . he then merely sit me down in front of a wholly fresh , but reasonably beaten-up laptop . i know that this be my chance to benefit from their relaxed and fluid business practice , and so i instal my standard programming environment , with help from the it team . i get to research on how i could use program to solve this problem , i then come up with the most practical approach , be web scraping . when i tell him , the head of department be amaze that this could be do with code , and be wholly on board , even go so far as congratulate me on the basis of strictly show initiative , and immediately order me another monitor ( such a cool guy ) . however , i have n't scrap or do anything remotely like it before , have merely complete half of free code camp 's front-end course ! so , the real issue be , after look at how i could go about web scrap with javascript , i quickly realize that all the book and resource for web scraping be for python . so , after a little deliberation , i bite the bullet and decide to learn python in a week . fortunately , python be one of the most elegant language i have use ( apart from clojure [ controversial , i know ] ) , so it be actually quite easy to pick it up , and i be scrap my first website within a week . while at the company , i make many friend ( some of which be now very good friend ) who have similar interest in cod and technology , which be great . it be the first time i be part of a community of peer who i could talk to professionally about something i care about . i besides start go to my local javascript meet up to build up that network and peer network . this go on until the middle of the 4th week , where i unfortunately realize that i would not be able to complete the scraper in time , so i do end up fall back on the manual monkey-work . by the end of the assignment , i have by all account fail , and have not provide a full and accurate data set and be drop by my agency . this be a dark time for me , as it felt like i be revert to the time before i be get off of my depressed ass to go find work . but , with a bit of perseverence , and regularly go to study cod at my library every day after look for job , i finally land a junior php/lamp stack job . not ideal , but a start . i be continue with free code camp , and hope to get into a react.js/ mean/mern stack job next , whether that mean convince my exist team or move to another…but hey , i 'm a coder now ! thank you free code camp , you change my life , merely as you say you would .\",\n",

       " \"last summer i spend a lot of time on upwork . i have vision of make it as a freelance copywriter . i work my way up from $ 3 an hour for transcription to a couple of decent $ 20+ hourly write gig , but then i find a full time job and stop freelance for a while . this summer , i decide i 'd rather write code for a living , so i 've be learn from fcc and everywhere else . about halfway through the fcc curriculum , i go back to upwork to update my profile and see if i could find any development job . i send a few proposal but i be a little daunt at the idea of try to sell myself to freelance client with no substantial experience in the field , so i decide to merely focus on learn enough to qualify for a regular full time job . a couple week subsequently , i get a message on upwork from a startup in california who need a react developer . i speak with the client ( vp of engineering ) and tell him right up front that i have no professional coding experience but i have be learn fast and i be confident that i could deliver good work . he agree to give me a test project under the guidance of the front end contractor who 's on his way out . three hour on the phone with the front end guy on tuesday give me a real eye-opening introduction to the world of professional web development . the app merely have two view and merely call three api endpoint but include thousand of line of code and a huge pile of dependency . i felt like i be drown at first . but then i have time to myself to dig into the project ( create a new view ) and everything come together for me . fast forward to today , and the vp call back and offer me the job ! for at least a month work remotely full time at an entry level hourly wage ( lower than most developer job , higher than any other steady gig i 've do ) , with the option to continue if we agree that thing be work out . he say that they consider some more experienced candidate , but that i stand out for my enthusiasm for learning and my timely and clear communication . the front end guy apparently tell him that i show a lot of potential and they do n't want to turn away talent . so now i 'm employ for at least a little while and if i fit in well at this company it could be a long-term job . and they come look for me . takeaway : create a profile on upwork and other freelancing site ca n't hurt , and if you already have some work history on such a platform it would be a good idea to keep your profile up to date and see if any client contact you , even if it 's not worth your time to go apply for contract yourself . reliable communication and commitment to learning can be your big selling point if you do n't have a bunch of ( or any ) prior experience .\",\n",
       " \"hey guy , like the title say , i be hire as a front-end developer after about 9-10 month after i start fcc . i 've always like to read thread about other camper who get a job , they give me a lot of motivation and optimism during my study . so i think it would be nice to share some thought with you . of course , it be all about my experience . as for my background , i have a bachelor degree not relate to cs , but i do have some experience in a few programming language , particularly python , which i use for text and data manipulation . some impression i have get from my study : i think it be truly important be to truly learn the basic . truly learn javascript before learn react , angular or even jquery ; learn css before learn bootstrap or foundation . your journey will be a lot easier and you will have a btter understanding of what and how thing be happen in these framework . you should keep an eye in what the company be ask to hire someone in the position you want . for me , i be look for a front end position and it be clear that overall the most requested skill be good knowledge of reactjs or angular . i learn a bit of both ( and vuejs , but unfortunately there be n't a lot of demand for it here in brazil ) and choose to focus in angular . learn git it be not that difficult but i merely get the hang of it after i start use for real in my project . and you can trust me , it be very useful . after i know i have a solid knowledge of the basic of webdev and a few good project to show , i buy a domain and host my portfolio to start apply for job . i be lucky in that i do n't need to apply for many position before i get a response from a company . they send me a test in which i have to make a small app in angular feature unit test that would consume an certain api . even though i do n't have a lot of experience i polish the app the best i could , follow the good practice i knew of . it be far from perfect , but they like my test and call for an interview . it be a good company and i be very excited with this new step . i be aware that this be merely the beginning and i will keep studying and do my best so i can become a competent developer . i be very grateful for fcc . even though i probably study more through other source , it be the most important resource for me in this journey . the structured curriculum and the nice community be so important . thank you all !\",\n",

i get inspire by the success stories quite frequently and hope i can pass the inspiration onwards ! the history like many of you , my educational background be wholly different . i have a degree in european public administration , however after finish my study i decide that i want something less dull . i find a job at a communications\\\\public affair agency as product owner for a web app for 9 month and get a job project manager at a small digital agency base on my achievement as product owner . however , the stress that i endure as a project manager be not my cup of tea and i quit after 4 month . i take a break and ask myself , what now ? i obviously like computer , new technology , however i always manage to find an excuse not to start programming . i try codecademy before but find it excessively superficial . then i read about fcc in a blog ... fcc i start fcc on december 26th , 2015 . i be immediately impress by the amount of message and activity in the gitter chatroom . wow , so many people , so many message and nobody be be a d*ck about noob question ... i race through the first challenge , motivate by the gamification and make my first portfolio website . look at it today bring a smile to my face how far i 've come . i continue to the algorithms feeling that moment of euphoria every time i find the solution . this feeling still motivate my today . i continue steadily with the rest of the front end curriculum and besides start on the backend . my freelance project february 2016 , someone in my family want a mobile app and so i decide to take it at a horrible hourly wage , know that the experience and the project on my resume would be very valuable . i make a very badly structure , spaghetti cod ionic app , which miraculously work . i 've be refactoring this app in the last two week and although i 've break reasonably much all coding standard and best practice , for the client it all remain the same ( lesson 1 : functionality > structure > performance ) . the experience with angular prove to be a major asset during my job interview subsequently on ... i besides create two wordpress and one drupal websites . even though these pay some bill , i find work with wp ( and to a much less extent drupal ) truly awkward . a reluctance to learn php , frustration with template and know that many people can now create their own website use editor make me shift focus back to js web apps ( lesson 2 : do what you love be more valuable than short term monetary gain ) . my own project in the meantime i 've do a few fcc challenge here and there and get my front end cert ( march '16 ) . but i always know why i want to learn to program to create my own awesome , niche web app : poldocs . it retrieve and search through political document from european , national and local level . with the learning from fcc and experience from my other project i felt super confident that i could pull it away . so in april '16 i start on my own app , full time . i 've never be so motivate in my life as i be when i start this project . i 'd spend well over 50 hour a week cod away on this project . then it bite me in the ass . i originally plan for it to be do at the end of august . i 've make a planning , set up my scrum board etc . do to the async nature of the import script i quickly find myself in callback hell with highly unreadable code . hurdle 1 : tame the async beast . it take me well over 2 week of reading and screw around before i find the best solution . i play about with promise , function generator and async\\\\await and have to learn es6 in the mean time . i 'm so glad i -reluctantly- move over to es6 and async\\\\await , now i wouldnt want anything else ( lesson 3 : learn es6\\\\esnext equally quickly as you can ! ) . hurdle 2 be merely around the corner . have tame the async beast i have to model a back end . as i have various import source with all different structure and format i try a one size fit all approach . it turn out to be a disaster , i try to model all kind of unnecessary metadata from different source and get frustrate when other source do not have that piece of information ( lesson 4 : keep the scope small , stick to the essential ) . furthermore , at this point i merely do the challenge and 1 project of the back end curriculum and think i be good enough . i be n't . i end up make many rookie mistake which i have to correct subsequently on . for example , when you know a field\\\\attribute of an object can contain multiple string , always use an array . even if it 's empty or merely contain one string ( lesson 5 : back-end and data modelling be hard . ask help ! ) . i even opt for a multimodel database 'cause i though i need graph functionality , i do n't , which make the whole thing even hard . it be however a truly cool database and you should check it out : arangodb . we 're talk october '16 now . by this time i 'm demotivated by miss my own deadline various time , encounter my own newbie error and have to fix them , money run out and gf start to get irritate by lack of result . i barely code more than 20 hour a week now and start to get depressed and doubt myself . i realize i 've bite away more than i can chew . i start to decrease the scope of my project and stick to the essential . it help and slowly i start to regain my confidence , i get most the essential work within a month , but i wo n't bring it online till every essential be do . i still need to do full text searching and realize that my chosen db be not adequate for this solution ... f**k , i need to add elasticsearch ... the job hunt money be run perilously low now , tension with my gf rising . i need a job . asap . i want to finish my own project as the center piece of my cod portfolio , wing by my pay project and build on a solid fcc foundation . i doubt that any company would accept a repo of a project that 's not even online as legit ... early november , i see an interesting job ad : js\\\\angular\\\\react\\\\mongo , socially engage . but it 's for a medior level ... i decide to call the recruitment agency however ( i do see this vid after all ) . i tell my story how i get into coding , what i 've do and what i 'm work on . i 've read dozen of post like these with tip so i know my most important asset at this moment be my enthousiasm . it work ! the recruiter -let 's call him recruiter a- indicate that he 'll contact the company to see if they 'd consider an entry level applicant with potential . i feel so happy and proud . the next day i get a call from the recruiter that they 're open to my job application , but i should n't get my hope up as they 're already take with several other candidate . that do n't hold me back ! i start on create my coding portfolio , show away some of my fcc project , pay project and my own -to be finished- project and send it to the recruiter . i review what i 've learn in the process , html5 , css\\\\sass , js\\\\react\\\\angular , mongodb , arangodb , docker , webpack , ionic , git , command line , linux , unit testing . damn , i 've come a long way ... ( lesson 6 : keep track of what you 've learn and take a moment to enjoy that occasionally ) 3 day subsequently i get a call , they 've opt for more experienced applicant . bummer . but i know it be a long shot , i 'm a junior after all . so i keep search for job , but about all require > 2 year experience . i think there be a lack of programmer ? ! the next week another i see another interesting job ad , this time for a pay traineeship with a large size it company , focus on oracle database , but now expand into web apps . include pay training at their company ... i might actually have a shot here ... i call the recruiter -let 's call this one recruiter b- and tell my story again , the guy be super excite by my story and invite me to send my resume and cod portfolio . next day , i get invite for an interview ! super hype next week i arrive at the interview , we start talk . i prepare for a technical interview , but all i get be question about my personality and how i rate my own programming skill hell , i do n't know , should n't you guy determine my level ? ! . so due to a lack of technical question i decide to profile myself more as a consultant . i leave the interview with a bad feeling , why the hell do i profile myself as a consultant when i 'm apply for a program job ? ( lesson 7 : make sure you ask what the interview process will be like beforehand ) 2 day of uncertainty follow . then i get a call . i expect to be invite for a second interview , but it 's not the recruiter i expect . it 's the previous recruiter , recuiter a ! as it turn out one of the guy they 've offer a job back out and now they want me to invite me to a job interview . hell yeah , two company baby ! so i indicate that i 'm willing to talk , but i besides let the recruiter know that i 'm in talk with another company ( after all , i 've read this amazing article on negotations ) . unfortunately the interview will not be schedule for another week and a half , wonder how this will play out ... the next day recruiter b call and invite me for a second job interview and indicate that this one will be much more technical . the second interview with company b will be schedule several day before the interview with company a ... game day . second interview with company b. i 'm super nervous , barely slept , but i do my homework , saw they use a lot of angular , so i read up on that and besides on test as that be a part of development i 've not do much with . i expect a whiteboard interview , but it be merely some question : what do webpack do , can you explain the difference between an angular service and angular controller , what 's a rest api , how do lexical scoping in es6 work ... i know all that stuff ! feel confident i start to fire back some question which -according to feedback subsequently on- besides make an impression ( lesson 8 : if you know more than the interviewer be ask , make sure you ask the recruiter about how they handle those subject ) . i leave the interview know i 'll get an offer . ace it ! two day subsequently i get a call . company b be offer me a job ! however , they say my level be not precisely right for a traineeship , they think i might get bore soon . allright , so no trainee , i 'll take junior ! the recruiter continue : `` but junior be besides not on your level , we 've assess your code quality with several programmer and although you still have a lot to learn we think a medior position suit your current knowledge '' . omg ! they offer a very decent salary + lease car . hell yeah ! i let recruiter b know i 'm super excite , but i already promise to go to the interview with company a , so i 'll wait how that go before commit . after a few day i have the first interview with company a. i 'm super relaxed for this interview , i already have a job offer which exceed my expectation so i do n't feel any pressure . however , i do my homework and i 'm give them a fair chance so i 'm approach it open mind . we talk about their product and they ask me a few truly noobie question , some of them : if i open a computer case what components do i find ? do you know es6 at all ? do you know webpack ? i feel a bit insulted . company b offer me a medior position and these guy from company a be ask me these kind of question , wtf ! ? so i counter : `` have you check out my repos ? '' . the interviewer reply : `` yes briefly , but merely some of them and they be n't truly that large . '' so i think to myself , this guy didnt even read my code portfolio and merely click a random repo for an fcc backend microservice . i keep my cool and respond that i will send him the link of the app i make ( which i start to refactor a few day earlier and look good now ) and my poldocs project . and he check it out . the end of the day i get a call from recruiter a that they besides want to offer me a job base on the interview and my repos i send . furthermore , they besides offer me a medior position , a higher base salary but no lease car . the recruiter indicate that they must be truly impress as they want me so much that they decide to skip the second interview . hell yea 2 out of 2 ! now i have a decision to make . i havent tell you about the background of these company yet , but it 's rather fundamental to my decision . both company know i do n't do it for the money but rather what i can learn ( however when you have two or more company fight over you , it doesnt hurt to see if you can get more . do you open this article yet ? you should ! ) . both company have give me a detailed description of how they see my growth potential , company a with a mentor for the first year , company b in a small team of 4 devs base on equality , no manager , no hierarchy merely the team pick up all issue together and discuss best way forward . i value both growth paths equal . but company a be a consult firm , mean i 'd be work on multiple project each year be outsource to different company around the country ( hence the car ) . company b on the other hand be in-house , develop their 2 application from front to back and even manage host in house and i 'd be expect to contribute to all of that . both have their pro and con . i think consult be fun : interacting with client , give advice , meet new people constantly . but consulting be besides deal with pressure , deadline , commute + traffic jam . you can fill in the opposite for in-house . in the end i choose for go in house : at this moment in my career i want to work on 2 project max , know those inside out and i do not feel like i be ready to deal with consult pressure again . furthermore there be besides some other benefit like work 1 day a week from home , full time be merely 38 hour there and a `` 13th month '' . ( lesson 9 : figure out for yourself what kind of company you want to work in , possibly you feel like you should take whatever come your way , but so do i and i think i 'll be happier this way in the end ) . i 'll be start january 2nd ! lesson 1 : functionality > structure > performance lesson 2 : do what you love be more valuable than short term monetary gain lesson 3 : learn es6\\\\esnext equally quickly as you can ! lesson 4 : keep the scope small , stick to the essential lesson 5 : back-end and data modelling be hard . ask help ! lesson 6 : keep track of what you 've learn and take a moment to enjoy that occasionally lesson 7 : make sure you ask what the interview process will be like beforehand lesson 8 : if you know more than the interviewer be ask , make sure you ask the recruiter about how they handle those subject lesson 9 : figure out for yourself what kind of company you want to work in , possibly you feel like you should take whatever come your way , but so do i and i think i 'll be happier this way in the end angular be use more than react in the netherlands do n't underestimate yourself : i though i be trainee\\\\junior level , but both offer me medior in the end try to find people ( camper or other irl ) who can assess your level try to find salary estimate base on your experience and location ( if you 're from nl i 'd gladly share what i 'll be get )\",\n",

       " \"edit : thank you all for the congratulation and encouraging response ! i go on vacation for a week and be wholly overwhelm by all the email and pms that result from this post when i return . there be a lot of question to see my resume/cover letter ; i be by no mean an expert but i 'll try to address those question in a separate post very soon . thank you all again and i 'll keep you update on the new job ! so it 's official . start october 16th , i will be an official , salaried front-end web developer . ( ! ) here 's a look at my cod journey : receive my bs in chemistry in 2014 . love the problem solving and be truly good at the subject but not wholly passionate about it… get accept to a chemistry ph.d. program and start in fall 2014 . drop out of the program before xmas break 2015 . i 'd enjoy some aspect like troubleshoot experiment , refining procedure , and teaching , but dislike most organic lab work . got hire for a part-time nanny gig i find fcc the week after i drop out and spend most of my ‘break ' learning . learn on-and-off while nannying and explore other income possibility ( i.e . marketing , craft , write , etc ) start the web dev job search around march 2017 while i be still nannying , but have to leave town to take care of my mom so i put the job hunt on hold . return home in may and continue my nanny gig ( i stop look for dev job since i be so grateful they 'd keep my job open while i be go ) . that become a full-time commitment . do n't do anything coding-related for several month , until i find a part-time marketing job with a tech-related nonprofit . be in a techy workplace inspire me to start cod again . about a month ago , have some minor emergency that make get a dev job my highest priority . after apply to ~5 job per day for a couple week , i get an email back from a company hire for a web designer/developer . they want to interview me the next day . how i prepare for the interview the job ad have be vague with no information at all about the company , except that they want someone with experience in bootstrap , front-end development , adobe design product , and the wordpress cms . when i receive their info in the interview email , i immediately jump onto their website to do pre-interview research . so note : this be n't an agency , but a small business look for someone to fill their sole developer position . my focus in apply or reach out to company be to make myself out to be the problem-solver they 're look for . the site this company own have a lot of issue - fixed-size item in responsive container , div-itis and divs be use to center thing in container , but wholly break the layout on mobile… ahh ! to foster a more conversational interview , i make a gigantic list of topic to bring up so that i could position myself as an expert . i bring my laptop and , during the interview , pull up chrome developer tool and pesticide , sang praise about version control and clean code , and so on . the offer i know woman ( and in general , everyone face impostor syndrome ) can be wary about come away as arrogant or advocate for themselves when it come to thing like salary and career advancement . i 'm normally the quiet , non-confrontational type and i 've never be in a situation of negotiate salary so i be catch a little off-guard during the interview . in the interview , my interviewer let it be know that i be the last person of many be interview and that they be shoot for an hourly rate that be merely kind of…meh . i be n't excessively thrill about it , so when they ask about my interest level i back away slightly and keep insist my salary requirement be higher than they be look for . lo and behold , after the weekend , i receive an email ask for a second meeting with this company . they start the meeting by say they talk it through and would meet my salary requirement , and they would be willing to further negotiation in 6 month time . i accept ! more perspective - where i 'm at i get my job offer ~22 month after start fcc . there be time when i be cod every day for week on end , and then there be time when i do n't code for month on end . when i fell away the bandwagon , i merely pick up where i leave away . sure , i have to do some backtracking but there be no need to wholly start over . i have n't even finish free code camp 's front-end certification , so do n't feel like you need to have a piece of ( virtual ) paper in hand to get a job . here 's my portfolio for reference . my cod advice get a local development environment up and run equally soon as you can . i use part of the odin project to get my computer setup and get start use git and command line . start a website - it do n't matter what it be . have the experience set one up be extremely valuable , and it look great on your resume . always be try to do thing better . learn about cool thing like modular css and functional javascript and always be try to improve . get out of your comfort zone . hate cs ? sign up for a challenge that will push you to improve . ( i 've come to realize that hate of a language/process/framework/whatever be merely my brain tell me it 's uncomfortable with its lack of understanding . ) do n't be afraid to invest in yourself and your skill . i love , love , love free code camp and all the free learning material out there , but there be merely some thing that would n't click for me until i find the right resource . apis , i 'm talk about you . for example , treehouse have save me many time over with their insanely clear big-picture explanation and focus on best practice . that 's not to say you have to go that route - merely know what work for you , and foster a learning environment that help you do your best work . acknowledge how far you 've come by help people who be merely start . this can be a huge self-esteem boost when you 're feel stuck . take break when you need to . i ca n't tell you how many time i 've get frustrate with a project , take a week away to not think about it , and have a glorious a-ha moment where everything suddenly make sense . cool job hunt resource how to write a good resume in 2017 : i follow the tip and resume template in this awesome post how to write a cover letter : once i start use these tip , i begin get way more response ( even if merely to say they appreciate my application and to reapply when i have more experience ) . you can find my blog at lupecamacho.com let 's be twitter buddy ! @ lupecamach0\",\n",

       " \"so , yesterday i finally get my 1st job in coding , and particularly in machine learning ! truly excite to share with you guy man ! and whole lot of thanks to everyone on fcc ! you guy be truly awesome ! i think end up get a job in the field of machine learning be a quite a different experience from most fccers , so i hope that share these experience with you guy will help you on your decision make when search for your dream job in the future , and besides open up more option to choose which field to specialise after finish fcc extensive curriculum . here be my story and experience to share with you guy . so i start out on fcc in july last year after drop out from my university since i could n't transfer my degree to cs . it be long long hour of cod back then until december when i start fcc backend project pair-programming with another fccer . at that time , she and i be besides search for job , and since we live in the same city , and so we can help out each other in find job . she want to get a job on ui , particularly css and rwd , and me particularly on angularjs or node.js , no matter as frontend , backend or fullstack developer . we get interview for a few time in our city . but since the pay for a junior developer in my country be highly low , she then decide to apply for a working holiday visa to uk , and try to get some progressive experience on ui design there . and now she be get a very good pay and learn some truly good designing skill there . about me , after complete some fcc backend project , but not all , i start to work on some project of my own base on my idea , while improve my angularjs and node.js skill increasingly . after a few month , i come across an article about machine learning , and be truly interested in it and get hook . after the legendary battle between lee sedol and alphago , and realise that the pay for a data scientist be highly high in my country , and with some prior statistic and algebra knowledge , i start to find the resource and tutorial to teach myself the cod skill need to be a data scientist . i 'm very appreciate to have incorporate the self-teaching skill i 'd gain from learn experience in fcc . since i 've get my coding foundation here in fcc , learn python to do data science be highly smooth . while learn data science , i 'd join some hackathons in my city and get to know some truly impressive people . lot of them be from startup accelerator program . we hang out sometimes for some coffee and then they bring me to their office , where lot of startup work there in a public area . then i get to know that lot of the startup team there be hire . so i bravely talk to lot of the team , and we share idea . very fortunately , one of the team there be look for someone who can code some machine learn algorithms then deploy it to the backend for production . know that they be hire , i maintain some meeting weekly with them to tell them what can i do and provide for them . at last , they hire me yesterday ! ! ! it be such a relief ! ! ! finally ! ! ! this be my dream job ! ! ! it have be about half a year since i leave fcc to pursue data science , but this all could happen merely because of fcc . big thanks to all the camper and anywho who 'd contribute ! before start out on fcc , i be trample about in the internet , particularly google to search for tutorial that best fit a beginner . but when i find fcc , i be so excited and immediately know that i would spend some month on here learn some coding skill . this be my story , it have be a year since i join fcc . it be a very long long journey , it 's hard but surely prove to be worth persist . i hope this story be motivate and encouraging enough and everyone here can get their dream job in the future . my advices:1 . for a non-cs-degree guy like me , get a job in a typical company be hard . possibly try interview job from some smaller startup . if you do n't mind a low pay , try to interview for an intern alternatively of a full-time position.2 . connection be highly important . join some hackathons and try to make as much friend as possible in there . you might not know any of their company be hire ! i 've a friend of friend of mine who now work in google merely 'cause of a good friend he 'd know in a hackathon.3 . everyone feel not employment ready at some point . after all , merely do n't care about it and show the recruiter and employer all the best project you 've ever done.4 . you 've learn a lot from fcc curriculum to become a fullstack dev . but if you 're not good at css but truly good at backend skill like me , you 'll have to be more professional on the backend than as fullstack do . if you 're good at frontend but not backend , you 'll have to be more professional on the frontend than as fullstack do too.5 . possibility be all out there . you might be feel not as confident when talk with other devs on some dev topic , merely be curious and ask . you 'll be improve after all.6 . opportunity be not merely to be find but can be create excessively . do n't be shy to talk about your capable skill . you would n't know that the one who you 're talk to might need you . you 're worth it ! work hard ! ! !\",\n",

) - but this be a good place to start - https : //www.udemy.com/react-redux/learn/v4/overview be consistent . i set myself block of time every day in a calendar to learn and build project and most week be work 25 hour or so outside of my 9-6 job ( wake up at 6am to study for a couple of hour , study in evening and weekend ) . be smart and fit study time around your life in a way which be sustainable for your own circumstance . codewars - this be a great way to learn javascript fundamental and truly stretch yourself . do it equally much as you can , while realise that it be your project which will get your foot in the door for an interview . structure your learning . i go through job listing early_on in my learning path to list out the technology that be most demand by employer and build a plan to learn and showcase most/all of them in project . have 90 % of the technology box tick against a job description make it much easier for you to get that interview . tailor to local market condition . find other developer or people learn to code to chat to . i 'm lucky to know quite a few people in tech ( range from junior to senior devs , product owner , system architect and tech manager ) who be invaluable in help me with problem , keep my morale up and provide advice . speak to as many people as you can ! apply to job people say job board be worthless be talk nonsense . yes , your strike rate will be very low , but who care when you can apply to scores/hundreds of job highly easily . a good cv and resume template which you can tweak slightly for individual job application will allow you to apply to job very quickly and easily . why not get your cv out there equally much as you can and see what the reception be ? that be say - leverage your connection and try to speak to hire manager directly . cold call them if you have the confidence , and send them speculative email tell them briefly about your experience and what you could offer their team . this be my sale background come in handy , but the reality of job hunting be that you be sell yourself , so act like a salesperson . do n't wait for opportunity to come to you , be proactive . the worst that can happen be a polite email say “no thanks” or you get ignore . no big deal . london specific - in my limited experience , this be a candidate 's market . i start search on january 4 and get my first offer on january 15 . i end up with 4 offer , remove myself from contention prior to final interview for 3 more company , and have to turn down numerous other interview offer . emphasie transferrable skill . i have no technical professional work experience or qualification , but interviewer still find a lot of value in my professional background and skill ( relationship building , presentation and communication skill , project management , other sale ability ) and this help me a lot in get interview , succeed in interview and negotiating . do n't think your non-technical skill have no value as a programmer ! do n't merely apply to junior position . most of the job i interview for be advertise as mid-weight position . plenty of company will be open to look at junior ! interview about all company require a take home technical test . these vary from multiple choice front end technical question , to build a simple front end responsive homepage , to build more complex application use data , ajax call , building in interactivity etc . if you get a take home project - make sure to comment equally much as you can , document the challenge you face , thing you 'd improve , additional feature you could include and so in with the readme . in general interview , this be the message that you want to get across - “i be passionate about coding , i can problem solve efficaciously , i have a hunger to pick new skill and develop exist one , i 'm open to new challenge and new approach , i can communicate clearly about what i 'm do and when i need help.” this be what company want from junior . they do n't care excessively much if you do n't know the exact name for an inbuilt method ( i forget what math.random ( ) be call in my final interview ) , but they do care that you can think your way through a problem and that you have an ability and method for find out how to do something if you do n't know it . interview them ! i probably spend more time ask employer question about their team , what they want from a junior , what their tech stack be , how success be measure , what i 'd be do etc than they spend interview me . you truly want to make the most informed decision possible about the company you 're go to work for , so probe them . interviewer like this - it show you have real interest in the role . be patient . do n't merely take the first role which be offer to you . figure out what you want from a role ( technology , progression opportunity , education opportunity , access to senior devs and mentor , salary , commute time , work culture etc ) and make an informed decision which compare these factor . my main decision factor be ( in rough order ) - access to senior devs/mentors , technology , progression opportunity , salary , and i 've be very lucky to find a role which tick all of these box more than i think possible come into this search ! thanks to fcc and @ quincylarson for building such an amazing platform for people to learn , build a community and spread the message about the possibility of learn to code without have to spend many ten of thousand of dollar on university course or expensive bootcamps .\",\n",

       " \"hi all , i want to start by say thank you so much to the development community as a whole and particularly freecodecamp . the help and support that we be surround with be unprecedented and be truly something of legend . i 'm work at a relatively small tech company 15-30 employee do front end work on top of their api and back end involve sale on our client ' site . our client include some very big name company that be find all over the globe . needless to say , as a first time developer , it be very exciting ! back in december of 2016 i make a commitment and promise to myself that i be go to become a web developer . i have no idea if i be go down the right path or learn the right thing or if i be even learn the right thing the right way . i google everything ! i use freecodecamp as my guiding arrow and try to absorb equally much information as possible . my tip : do as many project as possible , even outside of freecodecamp . between your project learn something new and then try to implement that in your next project . actually learn javascript ! ! ! i can not stress this enough . during my technical interview , the project leader even comment on the fact that they receive a countless number of applicant who put j on their resume but do n't actually know simple js i.e . manipulate array , create object , edit object , loop through object , etc . the algorithm section for javascript on freecodecamp help me beyond belief . i besides use project euler for add difficulty and more practice . learn additional framework . javascript entirely wo n't be enough to make you standout but if you can handle your own within javascript pick up additional framework will be a breeze . i advise you look at what 's popular in your area , but typically reactjs , and angularjs be good place to start . another comment the project leader make in the interview be that they do n't mind teach their developer , they actually enjoy it , but we ca n't be teach the basic . we need to have employee that have a strong foundation that we can build on . use your own text editor . codepen be highly nice and help get your project off the ground but at the end of the day you 'll want to be comfortable in your own development environment . besides start use git and github like yesterday . in a professional environment all the work you do will originate and end from here so your go to want to know your way around on day 1 . quit try to measure up . compare yourself to yourself . all excessively frequently we try to meet someone or something 's expectation that be outlandish and wild . this be your path and your choice . you decide where you go and how much time it take you . if you 've merely be learn for a month do n't look at someone else 's project or code and get discourage and think you 'll never get there . alternatively look at code or a project you do a month ago . systematically measure your growth to your past self . it will keep you focus and will foster encouragement rather than discouragement . read quincy 's email . no seriously read them . the links he post in those email include some reasonably amazing stuff . they 're always relevant and current . overall it take me 6 month to go from a nurse to a web developer . i work 3 12-hour day a week , and spend the other 4 learn my butt away . my wife want to strangle me for spend so much time on the computer . my son miss me , but i know the time and effort i put in now would finally pay away in the future . i switch career due to love and happiness . i struggle every bit of the way and felt like quit many time . i set my goal and achieve them no matter how long it take me . if you have any question merely comment below . i know how much value can come from gain any sort of insight into the process and path of switch career and become a web developer so i 'll do my best to give back equally much as i can .\",\n",

       " \"`` so… how much they be pay for programmer without a degree ? '' that come out from a co-worker last week . i 'm 34 year old employ front end developer from brazil , self teach like most of you guy read this post . no college or university degree . a couple month ago i do this post https : //forum.freecodecamp.org/t/one-year-of-fcc-gave-me-my-first-job-as-a-front-end-developer tell a little bit about my prospect after a long journey study program from free resource on the internet . now i 'm part of the self taught professional team and its a shame to state that we be at a great disadvantage . not merely by the number ( the vast majority work on this field be graduate people ) , but we 're lose in opportunity excessively . i do n't blame my it friend for that statement . he 's merely expect a better payment for his ‘plus ' . the industry have be condition us on that way for a long time : certificate and diplomas can prove that your be better . it 's a ticket to the upper level . i understand that though . back then thing be a lot more restricted . information do n't flow about for free like nowdays . i merely do n't get why we can keep accept this kind of mentality with the internet all over the place . i 'm not some subclass of employee merely because my resource be n't usual . i 'm do great on my current job work on lot of different front end project . actually , at the moment , i 'm the only web front end on a team of 25 developer . people come to me to ask js and css questions… but somehow it do n't count excessively munch for the ‘real world ' ! i do n't deserve a chance to even be able to be hear on interview ? or apply for position where the prerequisite i already have ? on top of that another detail that make me even more upset : i'am not wholly uneducated in the pos- high school . i have a 80 % mechanical engineer course on my history and a year of computer science . i do a lot of calculus and statistic . still do n't count ? nope . now i face a new challenge : i 'm make 4 dollars/hours on my current job and i need to find something more rentable . if i 'm lucky enough i will be able to double this value in 2 or 3 year . it 's reasonably hard to keep up with that amount and i do n't have much of a chance to make more than that without leave the country . so here i go again : i find out that look for abroad job without a degree in computer science ( or something like that ) be about impossible ! i do a lot of application and it 's so frustrating when you be reject because they ca n't risk to contact someone oversea without a degree . i get to the point where i have to offer remote assistance to show my competency on the job . “our policy do n't allow it” . how about the ‘cs degree or equivalent be require ' - for html/css and vue proficiency… truly ? to make thing a lot hard some country , like german and ireland , merely do n't let international worker apply without a degree ( theres a workaround if they have year of experience in the field ) . i get my current job with the help of the free code camp course and a lot of online resource . i do online course from university like harvard and princeton . i do a variety of udemy and udacity course . i have a lot of personal project on my github and codepen . i do n't get why people merely do n't realize or do n't care about how important be this experience from outside the classroom . i need to keep move forward i get ta pay the bill i want a better life for my little baby and i love this programming life but i need to say : some day i feel like i should have be more pragmatic about the dream of the self taught . sure , i do n't have a lot of option but if you get some money go for a college or a university . otherwise be prepare and look before you leap .\",\n",
