    "    description:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    This metric was originally called \"enlargedopacity\"; renamed as wordimportance_var1.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \"enlargedopacity\" is just a variation of the TF-IDF metric to measure word importance; the naming is just arbitrary and related to its use in this specific project.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    The importance of a word in this case is based on the combined effect of two metrics:\n",
    "    --- opacity: 1 - total count of word against total count of the most frequent word (1 - log(f_w)/log(f_maxw)):\n",
    "        this range between [0,1); the metric will penalize those words that are too frequent in the corpus, giving it a small value (close to 0)\n",
    "    --- sizing: 1 - (max count of a word in a text) / (total count of the word in all texts):\n",
    "        this range between [0,1); this metric is mostly a dispersion metric: the smaller the value, the larger the likelihood\n",
    "        that the word concentrates in only one text; it also penalises very rare words\n",
    "\n",
    "    opacity is about a complement of a TF variation (a standard TF is corpus' term frequency).\n",
    "    \n",
    "    sizing is about a complement of a IDF variation (a standard IDF is log( (Total Documents) / (Documents containing the term) )).\n",
    " \n",
    "    While opacity will favour the less frequent words, sizing will adjust opacity so those that are too concentrated in very few texts (too rare) get penalized.\n",
    "   \n",
    "    Using sizing as dispersion metric, words that are more common between different text receive better ranking.\n",
    "\n",
    "    \"enlargedopacity\" is the product of the frequency of the word against the most frequent word by its dispersion in the corpus, just like TF-IDF.\n",
    "    Its calculation doesn't deviate much from other variations of the standard metric (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf).\n",
    "      \n",
    "    The idea is to highlight those words that are more shared in the corpus without being too frequent ones. Those are more like (shared) topic words.\n",
    "\n",
    "    However:\n",
    "    --- Be aware that the metric is not normalized by text's length: the effect of the frequent appearance of a word because the text is long is not considered\n",
    "        This could affect mostly the dispersion metric.\n",
    "    --- The metric favours words that are shared; for topic modelling it will excludes words that define topics specific to few texts\n",
    "    --- The metrics assign value of (close to) 0 to penalised words: that makes those words to dissappear from the radar; it is like a hard L1 measure \n",
    "    --- In fact, it assigns value of 0 to less and very frequent words, suggesting they are the same when they are not\n",
